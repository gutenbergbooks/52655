<p class="caption2">PREFACE.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">This</span> memoir is a portion of the Catalogue of the
Woodwardian Museum which has been made at Professor
Sedgwick's request and at his cost. When the Professor
laid upon me his commands to prepare a Catalogue of the
Museum, it was planned in three distinct works. First, a
series of indexes to the specimens in the great divisions into
which the Museum is arranged; secondly, a series of memoirs
upon the orders and classes of animals concerning which
new knowledge is given by fossils in the Museum; and,
thirdly, memoirs descriptive of those species contained in
the arranged collections which are at present unknown in
scientific writings.</p>

<p>For the convenience of students the Catalogue is made
in parts. The Syndics of the University Press printed last
autumn as an example of the "Indexes to the Museum," an
Index to the Pterodactyles, Birds, and Reptiles from the
Secondary Strata. And this memoir is an example of the
second kind of Catalogue, which explains the structures of
the Pterodactyles of the Cambridge Greensand. In its progress
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">« viii »</a></span>
questions have arisen which necessitated an examination
both of the method, of research in comparative anatomy
and of its results in classification. And in so far as the
views here advanced differ from those commonly taught, the
discrepancy is due to the writer's imperfect faith in the
results of the inductive method of research, as commonly
used by modern writers on Palæontology. It has not been
consistent with the plan of this little work to do more than
scatter through it a few hints upon method, a subject which
will more fitly be discussed with a part of the Catalogue
which forms a synopsis of the osteology of the fossil animals
usually named Reptiles. The views here urged have however
but little of novelty. The name Ornithosauria was
proposed by the distinguished naturalist Prince Charles
Bonaparte in 1838. The group as an order was recognized
by Von Meyer in 1830. The affinities of the brain appear
to have been detected by Oken, and the bird-like character
of the respiratory system was expounded by Von Meyer.
And most of whatever this memoir contains has been
already thought or discovered by the German philosophers,
who have had the Pterodactyles as fossils of their fatherland,
though my own conclusions were arrived at separately
and from different materials.</p>

<p>The oldest Ornithosaurians are from the Muschelkalk
of Germany. In England the oldest are from the Lias,&mdash;several
species of Dimorphodon&mdash;a genus in some respects
nearly resembling the Pterosaurians of the Cambridge Upper
Greensand. In the Oolite of Stonesfield are several species
of Rhamphorhynchus or a similar genus. The great Pælolithic
period from the Oxford Clay to the Kimeridge Clay,
has yielded in its several divisions small Pterodactyles of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">« ix »</a></span>
new species. And the Psammolithic period from the Portland
Sand to the Lower Greensand has afforded many
excellent remains both of true Pterosaurians in the Purbeck,
Wealden, and Potton Sands, and of animals which indicate
a new order of Ornithosauria having affinities with Von
Meyer's thick footed saurians, the Dinosauria. In the Cretaceous
series, Galt, Upper Greensand, and Chalk all have
representatives of the Pterosauria; but no English stratum
has hitherto yielded so many as the Cambridge Upper
Greensand. From this formation the collection accumulated
during Prof. Sedgwick's long professoriate is unequalled;
though, excepting a few fine bones from the Chalk and the
Purbeck Limestone, the Woodwardian Museum is as yet
deficient in Ornithosaurians from the other Secondary Rocks.
Until descriptions of these animals shall have been published
a classification of the Ornithosauria must necessarily be provisional.
And it cannot be expected that descriptions of the
structure of Cretaceous Pterosaurians here given will hold
good for all the Ornithosaurian sub-class.</p>

<p>Finally, I have gratefully to express my thanks to the
many friends, English and German, who have aided me with
specimens and with their writings; to the chiefs and officers
of the English museums, especially Prof. Owen, Prof Humphry,
Prof Newton, Prof Phillips, Prof Flower, and Prof.
Huxley; to the officers of the University Library, especially
Mr Bradshaw, and Mr Crotch, for aid in consulting books;
but chiefly to Prof Sedgwick, who while employing me as
his paid Assistant to aid him in his Museum work, has
generously encouraged me to carry on for several years, without
restraint and as part of my daily labour, an investigation
of which this treatise is the first fruit. Prof. Sedgwick
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">« x »</a></span>
has placed at my disposal an ample number of copies for
distribution among those who take an interest in the Museum;
and especially among those who have contributed to
the Ornithosaurian collections, and aided me in my work.</p>

<p>The Cambridge Upper Greensand has yielded to collectors bones
which illustrate nearly every part of the skeleton of the animals
that are commonly named Pterodactyles. Large collections have
been acquired for the Woodwardian Museum. A series of more
than 500 bones have been arranged to exemplify the osteology
and organization of the Ornithosauria in the area when the Cambridge
Greensand was deposited. And this memoir is written to
explain briefly some of the structures of the soft and hard parts
of those animals which are exhibited or demonstrated by these
relics. Another collection of nearly 400 bones has been arranged,
which displays in association, as they were found entombed in the
old Greensand sea-bed, the remains of the skeletons of thirty-three
animals of the Pterodactyle kind. The whole of the remains
from this formation hitherto gathered cannot be computed to have
pertained to fewer than 150 individuals, which indicate a new
sub-class of animals, two new genera and at least twenty-five new
species.</p>

<p>The bones were mostly of a paper or card-like thinness, and
were originally hollow like the thin bones of birds. In the jaws of
other animals, and in the sea, they were easily fractured, so that
proximal ends and distal ends and shafts and split bones abound,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">« 2 »</a></span>
while perfect bones are almost unknown. Even those bones like
the carpals, which almost retain their entirety, invariably show indications
of having been rolled on the sea-shore among the nodules
of phosphate of lime with which they now occur, in their angular
margins being rounded, and in the removal of slender processes.
The rock in which these fossils are found is a thin bed of chalky
marl which is heavily charged with dark-green grains of Glauconite,
and is quarried largely, and entirely dug away to be deprived
of the dark-brown nodules of phosphate of lime with which it is
stored. In digging and in the subsequent washing, the workmen,
stimulated by an ample reward, pick out the fossils as they are
discovered. They are separated easily from the matrix of investing
marl, so that every aspect of each bone is seen, except for the
occasionally adherent oysters and the masses of phosphate of lime,
with which material the bones are also filled. Hence these remains
afford facilities for the study of the <i>joints</i> such as no other
specimens have presented; and from their large size and comparatively
great numbers, render easy the labour of the student who
seeks to contrast them with the bones of other animals.</p>

<p>The osteological collection has been formed without regard to
species or genera, and arranged to exhibit the structure and organization
of the tribe of animals. So far as possible each bone, as
humerus, femur, &amp;c., has its variations of structures and form
contrasted on a single tablet. The series comprises the following

<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">History.</span></p>

<p>The Cambridge Pterodactyles first attain prominence in scientific
literature in the year 1859. Professor Owen had figured
(plate 32, fig. 6-8) fragments of bones in the Palæontographical
Society's Monograph for 1851; the distal end of a large ulna
(fig. 6); the shaft of a phalange of the wing-finger, probably the
first (fig. 7); and the upper portion of the shaft of a small humerus
showing part of the radial crest (fig. 8). Inadvertently the last
specimen was referred to the Lower Greensand. But although
fragments of humerus of Pterodactyle and vertebræ of Pterodactyloid
animals have in the last few years been gathered from the
Potton Sands, those deposits were believed to be barren of fossils
when Prof. Owen wrote; and all the Pterodactyles yet made
known from near Cambridge were collected from the Cambridge
Upper Greensand.</p>

<p>Among the earliest successful collectors were Mr James Carter,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">« 4 »</a></span>
the Rev. H. G. Day, St John's Coll.; Prof. G. D. Liveing, St John's
Coll.; the Rev. T. G. Bonney, St John's Coll.; and Mr Lucas Barrett,
Trin. Coll.; and the Rev. Prof. Sedgwick, Trin. Coll., on
behalf of the Woodwardian Museum. Mr Day and Mr Bonney
both presented every specimen from their cabinets which could
enrich the University collection. And in the last ten years the
Woodwardian Museum has acquired, through the skillful collecting
of the Messrs Farren, the present materials. The associated sets of
bones were formed by William and Robert Farren, who, obtaining
the specimens from day to day as they were discovered, were
enabled to put together such parts of the skeleton as remained
together on the sea-bottom. These collections will hereafter be
used for the elucidation of species. They are the only materials
which can give the proportions of the Cambridge Ornithosaurians,
and the contrast of aspect which distinguished the living animals
from those from other rocks.</p>

<p>The other collections of these fossils are those of Mr William
Reed and Mr J. F. Walker at York, the Museum of Practical
Geology, and the British Museum.</p>

<p>The Woodwardian specimens as collected were placed in the
hands of Prof. Owen, and were first made known in the Professor's
lectures on reptiles and birds delivered at the Museum of
Practical Geology in 1858. In that year Prof. Owen communicated
to the British Association for the Advancement of Science,
and printed in their Report, the matter of the memoir which was
published with plates by the Palæontographical Society in 1859.
In this latter year Prof. Owen communicated to the Royal Society
an account of the vertebral column of Pterodactyles. In 1859
Prof. Owen also produced a classification of recent and fossil reptiles
at the meeting of the British Association, in which the order
Pterosauria appears with new characters&mdash;such as the pneumatic
structure of most of the bones&mdash;drawn from Cambridge specimens.
In 1860 Prof. Owen produced another memoir on Pterodactyles,
which was published by the Palæontographical Society. A brief
account of the tribe appeared about the same time in the Professor's
<i>Palæontology</i>.</p>

<p>In these writings are descriptions of the various parts of the
vertebral column. Their proc&#339;lian centra are described, and the
pneumatic foramina are noticed and supposed to have communicated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">« 5 »</a></span>
with air-cells. They are compared with birds, and distinguished
from birds; but although the order is classed with reptiles
no contrast with reptiles is made. Other bones described are a
basi-occipital, and a doubtful bone, then thought to be a frontal,
but which is more like the neural region of the sacrum.</p>

<p>The sternum is compared with the sternum of the birds
Apteryx and Aptenodytes, is stated to be formed, in the main, on
the Ornithic type, and to possess distinct synovial articular cavities
for the coracoids such as only occur in birds. The inter-coracoid
process of the sternum is compared with that of Bats, Birds, and
Crocodiles.</p>

<p>The mechanism of the framework of the wings is said to be
much more bird-like than bat-like, the anchylosed scapula and
coracoid being remarkably similar to those of a bird of flight.
The coracoid is shorter and straighter in birds than in Pterodactyles,
but no comparisons are made with reptiles.</p>

<p>The humerus is known only by the proximal end. It is said to
conform at its proximal end more with the Crocodilian than with
the Avian type, but to have the radial crest much more developed
than in either Crocodile or Bird. The bone is, however, chiefly
compared with birds, and is figured between corresponding bones
of a Vulture and a Crocodile. The pneumatic texture is said to
be as well marked as in any bird of flight.</p>

<p>Of the carpus it is said, the Pterodactyle, in the complete
separation of the metacarpus from the antibrachium by two successive
carpals answering to the two rows, adheres more closely
to the reptilian type than to that of birds. But the row which
was regarded as proximal is the distal row, while the supposed
distal row is proximal.</p>

<p>The claw-phalange and distal end of the wing-metacarpal, the
mandible, teeth, and jaw are the other bones described, but their
comparative osteology is not discussed. In the Professor's account
of a fragment of a jaw it is said, "The evidence of the large and
obviously pneumatic vacuities now filled with matrix, and the
demonstrable thin layer of compact bone forming their outer wall,
permit no reasonable doubt as to the Pterosaurian nature of this
fossil. All other parts of the flying reptile being in proportion, it
must have appeared with outstretched pinions like the soaring
Roc of Arabian romance, but with the demoniacal features of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">« 6 »</a></span>
leathern wings with crooked claws, and of the gaping mouth with
threatening teeth, superinduced."</p>

<p>When the specimens on which Prof. Owen had founded the
foregoing views of the osteology and classification of these animals
were at length returned to the Woodwardian Museum, it became
a duty of the present writer to arrange and name them. And in
a Memoir on Pterodactyles which was communicated to the Cambridge
Philosophical Society and read March 7 and May 2 and 16,
1864, a position was claimed for them, distinct from reptiles, as a
separate sub-class of Sauropsida, nearly related to birds.</p>

<p>In September of the same year a communication was made to
the British Association "On the Pterodactyle as evidence of a
new sub-class of vertebrata (Sauromia)," with enlarged drawings
of the skull and some of the other bones, in which the conclusions
arrived at were that, excepting the teeth, there is little in such
parts of the head as are preserved to distinguish the Cambridge
Pterodactyles from birds; and that the remainder of the skeleton
gives a general support to the inference from the skull.</p>

<p>Papers were communicated to the Cambridge Philosophical
Society on February 17, 1868, on indications of Mammalian affinities
in Pterodactyles in the pelvis and femur, and February 22,
1869, on the bird-like characters of the brain and metatarsus in
the Pterodactyls from the Cambridge Greensand. The other
references to Cambridge specimens are in a paper "On the literature
of English Pterodactyles" in the <i>Annals and Magazine of
Natural History</i> for Feb. 1865, and in "An epitome of the evidence
that Pterodactyles are not reptiles, but a new sub-class of
vertebrate animals allied to birds," in the same magazine for May,
1866.</p>

<p>In the meantime Prof. Owen's views have somewhat changed.
In the first volume of the <i>Comparative Anatomy and Physiology
of the Vertebrata</i> (1866), the Pterosauria are classed as the highest
group of reptiles, and take rank above the Dinosauria. In the
second volume of that work (1866), occurs the following passage:</p>

<p>"Derivatively the class of birds is most closely connected with
the Pterosaurian order of cold-blooded air-breathers. In equivalency
it is comparable rather with such a group than with the
Reptilia in totality, or with the Mammalia."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">« 7 »</a></span></p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">Organization.</span></p>

<p>Nearly every writer on Pterodactyles, who has expressed any
opinion at all, has formed an estimate of his own of their organization.
They have been assigned to almost all possible positions
in the vertebrate province, by great anatomists who all had before
them very similar materials. An account of these views is given
by von Meyer in his monograph of the Pterodactyles of the Lithographic
Slate. It will not be necessary to discuss these conclusions
here, for the materials from the Lithographic Slate and those
from the Cambridge Greensand are so different that no light would
be thrown on the organization of the animals by an exposition
of any fallacious inferences from German specimens. In England
they are classed with Reptilia, chiefly through the influence of
the discourse upon them given by Baron Cuvier in his <i>Ossemens
Fossiles</i><a name="FNanchor_1" id="FNanchor_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a>. It therefore may conduce to a clear view of the subject
to quote in Cuvier's words the passages in that memoir which
have been supposed to establish their position among reptiles.
He says,&mdash;"Ayant encore porté mon attention sur le petit os
cylindrique marqué <i>g</i> (i.e. os quadratum) qui va du crâne à l'articulation
des mâchoires, je me crus muni de tout ce qui étoit nécessaire
pour classer ostéologiquement notre animal parmi les reptiles."
The exact relations of the quadrate bone are not seen in either
Cuvier's or Goldfuss' or von Meyer's figures of this Pterodactyle,
the P. longirostris; but in von Meyer's figures of P. crassirostris,
P. longicollum, and P. Kochi it appears to be a free bone articulated
to the squamosal and petrosal region of the skull and with
the lower jaw. This is not the case with either Chelonians or Crocodiles,
which have the quadrate bone firmly packed in the skull;
nor is it paralleled even among those lizards and serpents which
have the bone as free; while, on the contrary, it is characteristic
of the whole class of birds. The form of the bone is not more
Lacertian than Avian, while its direct attachment to the bone of
the brain-case finds no parallel among lizards, but is exactly paralleled
in all birds.</p>

<p>Cuvier then goes on to say, "Ce n'étoit pas non plus un
oiseau, quoiqu'il eût été rapporté aux oiseaux palmipèdes par un
grand naturaliste<a name="FNanchor_2" id="FNanchor_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[B]</a>." Which position he supports as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">« 8 »</a></span></p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2" id="Footnote_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2"><span class="label">[B]</span></a> Blumenbach.</p></div>

<p>(1) "Un oiseau auroit des côtes plus larges, et munies chacune
d'une apophyse récurrente<a name="FNanchor_3" id="FNanchor_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[C]</a>; son metatarse n'auroit formé qu'un
seul os, et n'auroit pas été composé d'autanut d'os qu'il a de doigts."
These, though they may not be characters which are those of
birds, are certainly not eminently reptilian. The elongated form
of the tarsals in birds is peculiar, but quite functional, as may be
seen among the Penguins, where, when the so-called tarso-metatarsal
bone is no longer erect, it becomes much shorter, and is
nearly separated into three distinct bones. The cretaceous Pterodactyles
appear to have this bone exactly like that of birds.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3" id="Footnote_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3"><span class="label">[C]</span></a> This shown in other specimens since figured, and in the specimen from
Stonesfield in the Oxford Museum.</p></div>

<p>(2) "Son aile n'auroit eu que trois divisions après l'avantbras,
et non pas cinq comme celle-ce." This is a difference, but a difference
of detail only, and not a reptilian character. The creatures
have wings; and no reptile known, from recent or fossil specimens,
has wings. The general plan of the wing, though very
unlike, approximates to that of a bird. Most birds have two
phalanges in the long finger, though some have three. One Pterodactyle
is described as having only two phalanges in the wing-finger,
while most of the German specimens appear to have four
phalanges. In birds the longest finger appears to be the middle
one, while in Pterodactyles it is the innermost one.</p>

<p>(3) "Son bassin auroit eu une toute autre étendue et sa queue
osseuse un toute autre forme; elle seroit élargie, et non pas grêle
et conique." The pelvis of Pterodactyle is not reptilian, and no
living reptile has a pelvis like it. It is not unlike the pelvis
of a Monotreme, but the ilium is more Avian. It resembles the
pelvis of Dicynodon. And the discovery of a long-tailed bird-like
the Archæopteryx shows that the tail is like that of old birds,
even if it also presents some analogy in form to that of certain
reptiles and mammals.</p>

<p>(4) "Il n'y auroit pas eu de dents au bec; les dents des
<i>harles</i> ne tiennent qu'à l'enveloppe cornée, et non à la charpente
osseuse." This is not a reptilian character. Among reptiles some
tribes have teeth, others want them; and among mammals some
animals are without teeth, though they are so characteristic of
the class. It is an anomaly that birds should all be toothless.
And so, without citing the supposed teeth of <i>Archæopteryx</i>, it may
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">« 9 »</a></span>
be affirmed that it would be no more remarkable for some birds
to have teeth than it is for some mammals and reptiles to be
without them.</p>

<p>(5) "Les vertèbres du cou auroient été plus nombreuses.
Aucun oiseau n'en a moins de neuf; les palmipèdes, en particulier,
en ont depuis douze jusqu'à vingt-trois, et l'on n'en voit ici
que six ou tout au plus sept." This is a variation of detail such
as, had it occurred among birds, would hardly have been deemed
evidence of their affinities. When the variation of the neck-vertebræ
ranges from 23 to 9, the further reduction of the number to
7 becomes insignificant, and does not show that the animal was a
reptile.</p>

<p>(6) "Au contraire, les vertèbres du dos l'auroient été beau-coup
moins. Il semble qu'il y en ait plus de vingt, et les oiseaux
en ont de sept à dix, ou tout au plus onze." This modification is
obviously the result of smaller development of the pelvic bones
from front to back, and hence of the small number of vertebræ in
the sacrum. It does not support the reference of Pterodactyles to
the class of reptiles.</p>

<p>Speaking of the teeth, it is said, "Elles sont toutes simples,
coniques, et à peu près semblables entre elles comme dans les
crocodiles, les monitors, et d'autres lézards." The teeth of Pterodactyles
are (in the skull) for the most part in the premaxillary
bones, in which it is so characteristic for the teeth of animals to,
be merely conical and simple. Therefore it would have been difficult
to imagine the teeth to have been anything but what they
are, whatever the affinities of the Pterodactyle might be.</p>

<p>It is remarked, "La longueur du cou est proportionée à celle
de la téte. On y voit cinq vertèbres grandes et prismatiques
comme celles des oiseaux à long cou, et une plus petite se montre
à chaque extrémité." This adds nothing to the evidence for its
reptilian character.</p>

<p>"Ce qui est le plus fait pour étonner, c'est que cette longue
téte et ce long cou soient portés sur un si petit corps; les oiseaux
seuls offrent de semblable proportions, et sans doute c'est, avec la
longueur du grand doigt, ce qui avoit determiné quelques naturalistes
à rapporter notre animal à cette classe." Nor is this
evidence that the animal was a reptile. And in many minor
matters Cuvier is careful to show how their modifications resemble
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">« 10 »</a></span>
those of birds; and when this is not so, birds are the only animals
from which he finds them varying. And the few suggestions
which are thrown out respecting their affinities with lizards are
upon points which are also common to birds.</p>

<p>Thus what Cuvier did was to distinguish these animals from
birds, and incidentally to show that their organization was a
modification of that of the Avian class. And the legitimate inference
would have been that their systematic place was near the
birds, and not that they were reptiles.</p>

<p>But in Germany Cuvier's views on Pterodactyles have by no
means been submissively received; and great anatomists, since he
wrote, have propounded and defended views as various as those
of the anatomists who preceded him, and with no less confidence
in the results of their science. In the brief space at my command
it would be impossible to do justice to the works of this array of
philosophers, and therefore I present in a somewhat condensed
version the epitome of their conclusions given by Hermann von
Meyer in his <i>Reptilien aus dem Lithographischen Schiefer der
Jura</i>. They form a commentary on the casts of Solenhofen Pterodactyles
contained in the Woodwardian Museum.</p>


<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">Sömmerring</span></p>

<p>regarded the Pterodactyle as an unknown kind of bat, and
thought that Cuvier was misled by Collini's imperfect description.
He believed that he found in them different kinds of teeth as in
mammals; and regarded them as differing from bats chiefly in
having larger eye-holes, a longer neck, four fingers and four toes,
a longer metatarsus, and in having but one elongated finger; and
found the closest analogue of the fingers in Pteropus marginatus
of Bengal. And although inclined to place the Pterodactyle between
Pteropus and Galeopithecus, he suspects from the bird-like
characters of the head and feet that its true place is intermediate
between mammals and birds.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap caption3">Oken</span><a name="FNanchor_4" id="FNanchor_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[D]</a>.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_4" id="Footnote_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4"><span class="label">[D]</span></a> <i>Isis</i>, 1818, p. 551.</p></div>

<p>Oken reasoned carefully so far as his materials went. He
dwells much on the analogy of the wing to that of a bat, and
seems to suspect that the marsupial bones would hereafter be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">« 11 »</a></span>
found; and, excepting the head, finds that the other parts of the
skeleton have their corresponding bones among mammals.</p>

<p>Afterwards, when he saw the specimens at Munich, he was so
much struck at finding the quadrate bone of Lacertian form, though
Sömmerring could not detect it even with a microscope, that he is
shaken in his mammalian faith, and inclines to consider the animal
a reptile.</p>

<p>Wagler was impressed with the resemblance of the jaws and
the rounded back part of the skull to those of Dolphins, and so
far as the head went conceives it to have had nothing in common
with Lizards. He recognizes mammalian characters in the pelvis
and sternum, and fails, like Sömmerring, to detect a quadrate bone,
and finds the sum of the characters like those of other extinct
animals, such as Ichthyosaurus and Plesiosaurus, suggesting for it
a position between mammals and birds. He supposed it unable
to fly, that it never left the water, but swam about on the surface
like a swan, and sought its food on the sea-bottom. He imagined
the long arms to have been used after the fashion of turtles and
penguins to row the body along; while to the claws he attributes
the function of holding the females in the generative process.</p>

<p>sees in Pterodactyle an indication of the course that nature
took in changing the reptilian organization to that of birds and
mammals. The less important organs, those of motion, assimilate
partly to those of the bird and partly to those of the bats, but
always preserve the fundament reptile type and reptile number
of bones. The skull, fluctuating in character between the monitor
and crocodile, hides its reptile nature under the outer form of
the bird, but retains the teeth. To change the skull into a bird's
skull it would only be necessary that a few separate elements
should be blended together, and that a few peculiar bones should
be removed. The length of the neck, varying only in a few
species, is a deviation from the reptile type, and indicates an
approximation to the structure of 'the bird; but the number of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">« 12 »</a></span>
the vertebræ remains constant notwithstanding the increased
length. The fundamental plan of the crocodile may be recognised
in all the important parts of the vertebræ. The body of the reptile,
to be enabled to fly, would need a larger breast and a stronger
structure of the fore-limbs. The shoulder-blade of the reptile,
with its extremities forming the glenoid cavity, is necessarily
smaller and prolonged backward, and altered to resemble that of a
bird. The scapula only formed the back part of the glenoid cavity,
but it is thick and strong, suggesting an affinity with the bats.</p>

<p>The breast-bone, in the form of a shield, is changing into that
of a bird; as are the ribs, which are attached in a peculiar way to
the vertebral column. It is really the strong sternum of the
Chameleon, with moveable dorsal vertebræ. The whole chest is
supported by the peculiar continuation of the wings of the pubic
bones (Schambein). The ischiac and pubic bones resemble those
of the Chameleon, but the ilium runs a little down, like that of
a bird, and is only slightly connected with two sacral vertebræ, as
in reptiles, prolonging itself a little upward and forward, as in
mammals. The wings of the pubic bones exist in the Turtle and
Monitor, but of small extent; they are also represented in the
mammals by the upward development of the pubic bones in those
families, genera, and species, in which nature has indicated by
variety of shape, or peculiarities of development, or by affinities
with reptiles, quite a new type and capacity for variation
within certain limits, which is especially the case with certain
Rodents and Opossums, and Monotremes. It would not be
astonishing to find in Pterodactyles the marsupial bones. And
indeed the Pterodactylus crassirostris has a small tongue-shaped
bone, probably belonging to the pelvis. The less important part
of the skeleton, the tail, is formed precisely as in mammals, and is
identical with that of the bats. Both the thigh and shin are
mammalian, and only the foot retains the same number of parts
as in reptiles.</p>

<p>This animal was enabled by means of the pelvic bones and the
long hind-legs to sit like the squirrels.</p>

<p>We should regard this position as natural but for the long
wing-finger hanging far down the sides. If it were to creep along
it would have the same difficulties as a bat, and the length and
weight of the head, as well as the proportional weakness of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">« 13 »</a></span>
bind limb, make it improbable that they progressed by leaping.
These animals made use of their claws only to hang on to rocks and
trees and to climb up steep cliffs. They could fly with their wings,
and keep themselves aloft in order to catch insects or sea animals.
The wide throat and the weak and high supports of the jaw-bone
make it probable that they only used their teeth to capture their
prey and not to mince it. By means of their long neck, which
they usually bore curved backward in order to keep their balance,
they could stretch out their head to their prey and change their
centre of gravity, and so fly in different positions. The fundamental
type of the Crocodile and Monitor leads us to suspect that
they had a skin covered with scales. The approximation to the
shape of the Bird makes it probable that they were feathered. And
the whole outline, similar to that of the Bat, leads to the supposition
that they were covered with hair, like the Monotremes.
Goldfuss thinks he has got a clear insight into the covering of the
body and the whole condition of the wing in examining the Pt.
crassirostris. And the soft state of the stone near the bones he
attributes to the presence of the soft parts of the animal; and
supposes that on the original folds of the wing-membrane are to
be seen tufts and bunches of curved hair directed downward and
sideway<a name="FNanchor_7" id="FNanchor_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[G]</a>. And on the principal slab he finds evidence that the
Pterodactyle had a mane on the neck like a horse. The tufts on
the counter slab have some similarity with the feathers of the
ostrich. Some very tender impressions on both plates still more
resemble feathers. He recognizes the outline and faint diverging
rays of a bird's feather, but never sees a strong quill. The microscope,
instead of making the image clearer, makes it, on the contrary,
vanish, because then the rough parts become prominent.
Also on the slab which contains the Pterodactylus medius<a name="FNanchor_8" id="FNanchor_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[H]</a>, are seen
numerous lines and fibres diverging like a bird's feathers. And
on the upper part of the belly is the appearance of a scanty
texture of hairs and feathers. The visible marks of two cylinders
of the thickness of a quill, made of thin substance and filled with
limestone, he would regard as quills if there were clearer marks of
their feathers to be seen. As a note upon this von Meyer says,
after examining the slabs, that the particles considered by Goldfuss
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">« 14 »</a></span>
to be hairs and feathers rest upon appearances not only to be
seen in the vicinity of Pterodactyles, but which occur upon many
other kinds of petrifactions that have nothing in common with the
Pterodactyle; and that the roughnesses of the slab have nothing
to do with the folds of the wing or the muscles.</p>

<p>is so convinced that the Pterodactyles are Amphibians approximating
to the Saurians, that he does not think it necessary to go
into any controversy in the matter; but he acknowledges that
their forms sometimes present peculiarities of bird and mammal.
The head especially shows a blending of the bird and reptile types.
Its outline, particularly when seen from above, is that of a long-beaked
water-bird. And the long interval between the nose-holes
and the tip of the jaw, and the peculiar fact of a hole between
the nose and eye-holes, and the want of the continuation of the
coronoid of the lower jaw, rather resemble a water-bird than a
Saurian. But the presence and the form of the teeth show it to
be a Saurian; and not only the teeth, but the configuration of the
whole back part of the skull, reproduces the type of the Monitor.
The sclerotic circle is a peculiar mark of birds and saurians. Very
peculiar, however, is the extremely short back part of the skull;
and the articulation of the lower jaw, stretched far forward and
united just under the middle of the eye-hole. The more or less
long neck, which may assume the form of an S, deviates very
much from the short stiff neck of reptiles, and is quite bird-like,
the neck-vertebræ of which those of the Pterodactyle closely resemble
in shape; while their constant number of seven reminds
us of mammals and crocodiles. The neck has the same flexibility
as in a bird. The short and weak trunk-vertebræ are in such disproportion
to the length and strength of the neck-vertebræ as is
never met with even in the birds and mammals which have the
longest necks. The trunk-vertebræ are completely separated from
each other, and may be divided into dorsal, lumbar, and sacral
vertebræ. The transverse processes of the back-vertebræ are
notched out like those of the crocodile. The tail is short in
most species, and this is a deviation from the type of the Saurians,
and an approximation to birds and to many mammals. But
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">« 15 »</a></span>
there are some kinds with very long tails, as is the case with mammals
and usually with Saurians. But the vertebræ of these long-tailed
Pterodactyles deviate very much from those of Saurians.
And while the Saurian vertebræ are provided with long transverse
processes and upper and lower spinous-processes (Dorn-Fortsätzen),
they seem in the Pterodactyle to be almost devoid of processes
and resemble those of mammals, on the tails of which these processes
soon disappear. In a certain point of view we could say of
the vertebral column of the Pterodactyle, that it has borrowed
the neck from the bird, the trunk from the reptile, and the tail
from the mammal. The ribs are connected to the transverse processes
as in crocodiles, except with the atlas and axis. Quite in
the type of the Saurians are the abdominal ribs, which are wanting
to all birds and mammals, but often occur in the Lacertian order.
The structure of the shoulder and breast-bone separate the
Pterodactyle from the mammal, these parts being formed after
the type of the Birds and Saurians, the characters of which
are blended together. The small and elongated shoulder-blade,
like the coracoid bone, belongs to the type of the bird rather
than to that of the Saurians, of which, in reference to the last-named
bone, only crocodiles have a similar one. The breast-bone,
by its large expansion, points to the crocodiles, but at the same
time, by the want of the keel, points to the ostrich-like birds,
save that it is proportionally larger and wider than in these. The
Pterodactyle, in common with the crocodile, wants the patella.
The pelvis is formed on the type of the Saurians, although the
ilium, by length and form, points somewhat to the mammals. The
length and delicate form of the long bones of the limb, as well
as the larger development of the fore-arm than of the upper-arm,
and larger development of the lower thigh than of the upper thigh,
and the thinness and elegance and shortness of the ?fibula (Wadenbein)
have the characters of birds. The length of the middle hand
[metacarpals] resembles that of birds, but its form in Pterodactyle
is conformable to that of mammals. The first three fingers have
the form and condition of the phalanges of lizards. The phalanges
form the series 2, 3, and 4. The fourth, or air-finger, on the
contrary, is of a peculiar type, of which no analogue is found in
other animals, unless a somewhat similar arrangement be accredited
to the bats. It is of enormous length, composed of four
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">« 16 »</a></span>
parts and without a claw. The hind-leg is, in proportion to the
fore-leg, weak, and in general does not take the bird-form, but
that of a Saurian. It has five toes, with unusual arrangement
of the phalanges into the series 1, 5, 4, 3, 2. One toe has
no nail, and the others have claws weaker than those of the
hand. It can hardly be supposed that the animal lived in the
water. All Saurians that live either in the water or on land are
short-legged; it is the same with the swimming birds. But the
Pterodactyle has its hind-legs as long as a land or air-bird; and
as in these, the shin especially exceeds the length of the thigh.
At the same time the toes, when they are in their natural position,
were so close together that we may suppose the animal not
to have been web-footed. The great development of the hand, by
means of the long middle hand and especially of the enormous
length of the air-finger, makes it probable that it was the chief
organ of flight, as in birds and bats; also deviating in a peculiar
manner from both these types, the long air-finger served to
expand the wing-membrane, which extended from the upper part
of the finger to the trunk, and which in all probability did not
touch the hind-legs. This we infer from the circumstance that
the animal, in a position with the organs of flight folded up, was
not supported like the bat on its four feet, but stood upright on
its hind-legs like a bird. Such a position presumes the same
freedom in moving the hind extremities as with birds; only in
such a position could the animal walk on without being hindered
by its flying organs when they were folded up like those of a bird.
Only in such an upright position could the animal keep upright
its unusually long head with the long and strong neck and be kept
in balance, the neck being able to take a sigmoid curve like that
of a bird.</p>

<p>Wagner concludes: "By these means we have recognised in
the Pterodactyle a Saurian, but of a habitude which greatly
removes him from all others of his kind, and approximates him to
birds. Excepting in ability to fly, he has nothing in common
with the birds. The opinion 'that the animal is half crocodile
half monitor disguised as a bird, but intending to be a bird,' is
therefore not only a paradox but also false. With more truth,
but less phantasy, we could say that the Pterodactyle was a
Saurian in transition to the Birds."</p>

</div>

<p>In the long thigh, with the long neck, Quenstedt sees evidence
that the animal was able to walk upright, being probably still
more upright than birds, since the great disproportion between
the neck on the one hand, and the thigh on the other, could
not have allowed a more appropriate position. At the same
time he makes a question, Did it go on four feet? But a little
later, in his book, <i>Sonst und Jetzt</i>, 1856, he gives a sketch
of the animal resting on its four legs; and remarks, "The position
upon four feet is however hypothetical, but is probable.
It had its wings folded back. The slightly curved and thin
bones of the middle hand probably served to support the flying-membrane,
and had therefore the same function as the spur-bone
in the bats." Finally, he says in his book, <i>der Jura</i>, p. 813,
"Perhaps this animal walked from time to time on four legs,
being then supported by the fore-end of the metatarsal bone."</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap caption3">Burmeister</span><a name="FNanchor_11" id="FNanchor_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[K]</a>.</p>

<p>entirely rejects Quenstedt's opinions with regard to their upright
position. He makes the following remarks: 'The animal walked
on the free fore-toes and bore the wings like a bat, though with the
body not in an upright position like a bird, but four-footed. The
hind-foot is much too small for such an upright position, and the
fore-foot much too strongly developed. I therefore believe that the
Pterodactyle could much better have walked four-footed than a
bat, because it possessed so much better developed fore-feet.' In the
length of the tibia Burmeister sees no reason for the upright position,
but, as he says, only a means for the wide expansion of the
flying-membrane;&mdash;and an endeavour in walking on four feet to
bring the leg into the necessary harmony with the arm, which is
so much elongated with the flat-hand.</p>

</div>

<p>The skull of the Pterodactyle can only be compared with those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">« 18 »</a></span>
of birds and lizards. The form is essentially Avian, and the
sutures are indistinct or obliterated as in birds, while in reptiles
they are persistent The temporal bone enters into the formation
of the reservoir for the brain, which is eminently characteristic of
birds and quite different from anything found in lizards. The
snout resembles a bird in being chiefly formed by the intermaxillary
bone, which bounds the front of the anterior nares; and, as
in birds, the bone extends backward between the eye-cavities to
the frontal bone. The corresponding intermaxillary ridge of
the Monitor is of less extent.</p>

<p>The frontal-bone forms the highest part of the skull, and is
similar to that of birds. The principal frontal is double, and
forms the upper and hind part of the cavity for the eye, and
covered the greater part of the large brain, composed of two
hemispheres, in which Oken long ago saw a similarity to the
higher animals. The arched form of the back part of the skull is
bird-like. The double parietal adjoins the principal frontal, and is
conditioned like the parietal in birds. The supra-occipital is single
as in birds, expanded, and forms the part of the skull which extends
furthest back. From the form of the back part of the
skull it may be concluded that the foramen magnum was situated
as in birds, and that the head and neck were moved as in birds,
and not as in reptiles and mammals.</p>

<p>The temporal bone rests upon the parietal and frontal, and
forms much of the temporal foss. Its anterior border does not
appear to enter into the margin of the orbital cavity as in birds,
but seems to be replaced by the post-frontal, which resembles
that of the Chameleon. Its hindmost branch, which can hardly
be supposed to be the jugal, forms the outer boundary of the temporal
foss by uniting with a process which is probably part of the
mastoid. A similar closing of the cavity for the temporal muscles
is also to be found in birds. The jugal and maxillary do not
follow the bird type. The jugal consists of a single bone which
forms the greater part of the anterior and inferior boundary of
the cavity of the eye, which is surrounded with bones, as in
Dragons and Iguana. In those birds in which the cavity of
the eye is surrounded with bones the jugal does not enter into it.
As in lizards, at its upper end the jugal is commonly connected
with the lachrymal, which bone is like that of a bird.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">« 19 »</a></span>
A bone, which appears to be the pre-frontal, enters into the back
of the nasal aperture.</p>

<p>The nostril is double and often of large size.</p>

<p>The perforation in the skull between the orbit and nares is
bird-like.</p>

<p>The quadrate bone is not quadratic as in birds, but cylindrical
and shaft-like, as in the Chameleon. The articulation of the
quadrate with the lower jaw is placed further forward than in
birds and reptiles. The lower jaw, but for the teeth, has great
similarity with that of a bird. Among reptiles its nearest resemblance
is with Chameleons and Turtles. The hyoid is more bird-like
than reptile-like.</p>

<p class="caption4"><i>Ribs and vertebræ.</i></p>

<p>It is uncertain whether the Pterodactyle had lumbar vertebræ.
If they are wanting, therein the animals resemble birds, of which
we are reminded in the short and stiff back and moveable neck.
Pterodactyles possess a smaller number of neck-vertebræ and a
larger number of back-vertebræ than birds. The long neck-vertebræ
are paralleled by those of water-birds, by the Giraffe, the
Camel, Protosaurus and Tanystrophæus. There are 7 cervical vertebræ,
the 1st very short, 2nd not longer, but rather shorter than
those which follow. There are in Pterodactyles from 12 to 16
dorsal vertebræ, while birds have never more than 11. It is not
certain whether all Pterodactyles have an os sacrum; most have it,
and therein resemble Mammals, Birds, and some fossil Saurians.
In Pterodactylus dubius and P. grandipelvis and P. Kochi there
are 5 or 6 vertebræ in the sacrum. In birds the sacral vertebræ
vary from 5 to 22; in bats the number is from 5 to 6.</p>

<p>The short tails of Pterodactyles are more like those of mammals
than birds; they include from 10 to 15 tail-vertebræ. In
birds there are from 6 to 10 tail-vertebræ. Rhamphorhynchus has
38-40 tail-vertebræ, secured between thread-bones like those in
the tail of rats.</p>

<p>The dorsal ribs are reptile-like. In herbivorous mammals and
birds they are broader. A few species have the first pair of ribs
large. The abdominal ribs belong neither to birds nor mammals,
but are reptilian. In Rhamphorhynchus Gemmingi there are 6
pairs of sternal ribs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">« 20 »</a></span></p>


<p class="caption4"><i>The sternum</i></p>

<p>is bird-like, somewhat resembling lizards. It consists of a simple
flat bone, but without the keel of a bird's sternum. It is relatively
smaller than in birds, is broader than long, and therefore
comparable with Struthious birds. They were not able flyers,
since the part to which the muscles for flight should be affixed is
wanting. And for the same reason they could not have been
wandering animals. But Moles possess a keel on the breast-bone,
which therefore is no evidence of flight. And in swimming-birds
which do not fly the keel is much developed; and in swimming-birds
the sternum is also long, so that neither length nor keel
prove flight. So far as the evidence from the sternum goes, they
were neither water-birds, nor diggers, but denizens of the air.
In Rhamphorhynchus Gemmingi, besides the usual breast-bone,
there is a plate with breast-ribs uniting the sternum with the
dorsal ribs; they are cartilaginous, or horny, as in birds.</p>


<p class="caption4"><i>The scapula and coracoid</i></p>

<p>present the closest resemblance with those of a bird, and only
deviate in the coracoid not being inserted in the breast-bone in
the manner of birds<a name="FNanchor_13" id="FNanchor_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[M]</a>. It at first seemed that Rhamphorhynchus
differed from Pterodactyle in having the scapula and coracoid
anchylosed. In R. Gemmingi the bones are either separated or
only slightly united.</p>

<div class="footnote">
<p><a name="Footnote_13" id="Footnote_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13"><span class="label">[M]</span></a> See however Pl. 1 and 2 of this memoir.</p>
</div>

<p>Oken and Goldfuss thought that the scapula consists of an
upper and under part, as in lizards. Von Meyer sees nothing
of the kind.</p>


<p class="caption4"><i>The humerus</i></p>

<p>presents no striking similarity with birds, and differs from bats.</p>


<p class="caption4"><i>The carpus</i></p>

<p>is more reptile-like. It consists of two rows of small bones. In
birds there is one row made up of two bones.</p>


<p class="caption4"><i>The pteroid bone.</i></p>

<p>Von Meyer regards it as having supported the wing-membrane
in flight. There has been a good deal of difference of opinion
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">« 21 »</a></span>
about it, some thinking it, with Quenstedt, an ossified tendon;
others, like Wagner and Burmeister, regarding it as an essential
part of the Pterodactyle skeleton. Von Meyer regards its extent
as indicating the extent of the wing-membrane. See p. 42.</p>


<p class="caption4"><i>Metacarpus.</i></p>

<p>In length the metacarpus resembles that of the Ruminants,
in which however it consists of but one bone; while in Pterodactyles
there is a separate bone for each of the four fingers; they
are closely united together without being blended. In some
Pterodactyles the metacarpals of the short fingers are as fine as
hairs, so that it is impossible that they should have articular
facets on the carpus. In Ornithopterus the metacarpus has some
resemblance with that of the bird, but the articulation with the
phalanges of the finger for flight is stiff. In Pterodactylus and
Rhamphorhynchus there is a free articulation.</p>

<p>Burmeister remarks that the chief articulation of the wing in
bats is with the carpus, while in Pterodactyle the articulation is
with the end of the metacarpus.</p>


<p class="caption4"><i>The hand.</i></p>

<p>Von Meyer finds four fingers. It was formerly supposed that
the order of the phalanges was 2, 3, 4, 4, but in the fly-finger this
is not the case, Ornithopterus having but two. The number of
joints in the other fingers is quite as irregular.</p>

<p>In Pt. longicollum the thumb consists of but one joint.</p>

<p class="caption4"><i>Foot.</i></p>

<p>Von Meyer never finds more than four toes, and sometimes a
stump of a fifth. As a whole, the foot is Saurian-like. It differs
from lizards in the number of toes, and approximates to Crocodiles.
In Pterodactylus longirostris the formula of the toes is 2, 3, 4, 5,
with a stump of two joints;&mdash;like lizards, if we abstract the outer
toe; and like birds with four toes; but they are liable to variations.</p>

<p>In Pterodactylus scolopaciceps and P. Kochi the formula is
2, 3, 3, 4 joints. In Winkler's specimen of P. Kochi there is
also a stump of three joints.</p>

<p>In Pterodactylus micronyx the formula is 2, 3, 3, 3, and a
stump of two joints. In P. longicollum the number appears to
be different from all the foregoing.</p>

<p>The stump was attached to the side of the outer toe. Wagner,
in P. Kochi, supposed it to be on the inner side, and so gave a
reverse arrangement to the toes. The stump may be compared
with that of some Chelonians, in which it is not furnished with
a claw.</p>

<p>There is a difference from birds in the claws being much less
developed. It has a true reptile foot. In bats the toes are of
equal length. Von Meyer thinks the hind-legs did not enable it
to walk on the land.</p>

<p>In some Pterodactyles the flying-membrane is faintly seen.
The presence of feathers might be inferred from there being but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">« 23 »</a></span>
one finger for flighty as in birds; but the function of feathers is
subserved by the long and stiff finger. If it had been covered
with scales, as was supposed by Cuvier, some traces of them would
be found. The skin was probably naked, and had no connection
with the hind-legs as it has in bats; in this respect resembling
birds.</p>

<p>The condition of the several parts of the skeleton completely
proves that the Pterodactyle was a reptile. Its head, neck,
shoulder, and back, resemble a bird; while there are, on the other
hand, some striking resemblances with the reptile in the pelvis,
tail, and articular parts of the limbs. Sometimes the characters of
the two classes run side by side, as in the skull, the fore-limbs,
and especially in the hind-limbs, where the shin of a Bird is connected
with the foot of a Saurian. The parts in which it corresponds
with birds show that Pterodactyles also were flying animals.
That we should be entitled to conclude, from the hollow state of
the bones, that they belonged to flying animals, is sufficiently
proved by Blumenbach, Buckland, Mantell, Owen having mistaken
them for bones of birds.</p>

<p>The most absolute proof that it was a flying animal is the
pneumatic character of its bones. This condition was discerned
by me in some Pterodactyle bones from the Lias of Franken
(<i>Jahrb. für Mineral</i>, 1837, p. 316), and was afterwards established
by Owen in the Pterodactyles from the Chalk of England.
This structure was previously only known in birds. And the supposition
readily follows that in the respiratory process there was
some similarity between the Pterodactyle and the Birds. They
have the proportions of upper-arm and fore-arm which characterize
birds of great flight, the humerus short and the fore-arm long;
hence it may be presumed that Pterodactyles could fly well. From
the absence and presence of the bony sclerotic ring in the eye, it
may be supposed that the Pterodactyles were active in the day-time,
while Rhamphorhynchus was nocturnal.</p>

<p>After this statement von Meyer gives a discursive summary,
in which his views of the classification of reptiles in general and
of Pterodactyles in particular are epitomized. And then goes
on to combat the views of people who have departed from his
classification and attempted to set up classifications of their own;
and cites a number of authors who, labouring at the vertebrata,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">« 24 »</a></span>
have endeavoured to find a resting-place in their systems for the
Pterodactyle. But the chief thing we learn of von Meyer's own
views is, that in 1830 he published a classification of extinct Saurians,
dividing them into those with limbs like the larger and
heavier land-mammals, those with fin-like limbs, and those with a
flying-finger. Which divisions have been widely adopted, though
authors have sometimes given them other names than those by
which they were first made known.</p>

<p>Von Meyer has freely stated the facts about the Pterodactyle,
and draws the conclusion that the animal was a reptile; but
how such a conclusion was obtained from such facts is a matter on
which his pages are silent. One seems to hear the chirrup of the
bird in  almost every paragraph. The head is in the main a bird's
head; the pectoral girdle and the sternal ribs are those of a bird;
and very few are the structures in which some reminder of the bird
is not present; and in their bones he discovered the pneumatic
characteristic and inferred, for the animals bird-like lungs. How,
then, comes it that the Pterodactyle is a reptile? We can only suppose
the answer to be, Because if the head and pectoral girdle
and other bones had been reptilian it would have been a bird.</p>

<p class="tb_stars">*       *       *       *       *</p>

<p>In the views here epitomized it is difficult always to make out
the logical foundations of the conclusions arrived at. Sometimes
they have no foundations, and sometimes they represent the different
aspects in which a truth presents itself to minds differently
constituted or differently conversant with the structures of living
animals. In now stating my own views I shall avail myself of
the example of some previous writers, and attempt to investigate
the Pterodactyle as though they had not written. And then,
having placed before him all the theories that are known, the
reader will be able to choose the theory that pleases him best,
if indeed he needs one.</p>

<p>Much of the discrepancy of opinion that exists is probably due
to the use of the inductive method of thought for the discovery of
fundamental principles in classification. In palæontology, where
the types are more generalized than are living forms, it must
always be difficult to reason from the known to the unknown.
The known is always more or less incomparable with the unknown;
and there can be no reason for inferring that the specialities of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">« 25 »</a></span>
structure which now accompany specialities in organization would
justify us in inferring for the animal, in which the structures
formerly were united, the combined organizations of the living
animals in which they are now found. On any hypothesis of evolution
it would be allowed that the special modifications of a group
were attained subsequently to the common plan of the larger
group to which it belongs, and are entirely to be attributed to
the function which the necessities or organization of the animal
caused its structures to subserve. Inductive thought may sometimes
discover function from structure, but never makes more than
an approximate guess when it endeavours to determine fundamental
organization from osseous structures which are not fundamental.
And before a naturalist can say, since an animal has for instance a
tail like a mammal that in so far it must be affiliated to the mammalia,
he must have determined why the mammalian tail has its
peculiar characters, and whether it is compatible with any other
common plan of organization. And perhaps it might with equal
reason be considered reptilian.</p>

<p>Therefore I prefer at firsts instead of reasoning from the details
of structure, to adopt the <i>à priori</i> method, and ask, not what the
Pterodactyle is like in its several bones, but what common plan it
had whereon its hard structures were necessarily moulded. For I
imagine, if it can be determined what the nervous and respiratory
and circulatory structures of the Pterodactyle were, it becomes a
secondary matter to know whether the phalanges are like a lizard's,
or the pelvis like that of a mammal. If the animal is asserted to
be a mammal, a reptile, or a bird, we ought to be able to adduce
evidence that it had the soft parts which are deemed distinctive
of the selected class. This no one has done or attempted to do.</p>

<p>Hereafter it will be necessary to describe the Pterodactyle's
brain.</p>

<p>There is no organ more distinctive between hot-blooded animals
on the one hand, and cold-blooded animals on the other,
than the brain. In the cold-blooded groups, or those in which
respiration is feeble and circulation imperfect, that is to say, in
existing fishes, amphibians, and reptiles, the parts of the brain are
arranged one behind another, so that when looked upon from
above, a portion called the optic lobes intervenes between the
anterior masses called the cerebrum and the posterior mass called
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">« 26 »</a></span>
the cerebellum. In the hot-blooded groups, or those with an
enormous extent of lung-surface for oxidation of the blood and a
four-celled heart for its rapid circulation, that is to say, in birds
and mammals, the front part of the brain called the cerebrum is
immensely developed in proportion to the other parts, and abuts
against the cerebellum and more or less completely covers the
optic lobes, which in birds are squeezed out to the sides. The Pterodactyle
brain is of this latter kind. And it being taken as a
postulate that this kind of brain is the product of the organization
which produces hot blood, it follows that the Pterodactyle was
a hot-blooded animal.</p>

<p>Again, the Pterodactyle has perforations for pneumatic cells
in many of the bones.</p>

<p>There is no structure in the animal kingdom more distinctive
of a Class of animals than air-cells perforating the limb-bones.
They are connected with a peculiar kind of lung and heart&mdash;those
of the bird; for in this Class the bronchial tubes open on the outer
surface of the lungs into air-cells, which are prolonged through the
body into the bones. They follow the blood-vessels, and are most
developed in the part of the body most used. In some lizards, as
the Chameleon, the sack-like lung at its distal termination is as
simple as the air-cells of a bird; but those air-cells are not comparable
with the bird's air-cells, since they are not prolongations
of the bronchial tubes through the walls of the lungs. And it
cannot be inferred that a reptile with wings would develop air-cells
like those of a bird: in the first place, because those mammals
which have wings do not develop air-cells; and, in the second
place, because there is nothing in existing nature to lead any one
to think that reptiles might have wings. The mammalian lung
is better comparable to that of a bird than is the Chameleon lung,
and therefore the air-cell structure might with better reason have
been anticipated to occur in the Chiroptera than in a Lizard-ally,
if it were dependent on the development of wings. Moreover,
among Struthious birds the legs have more of the air-cell prolongations
than the wings. Therefore, being a peculiar Avian structure
which only exists in association with the Avian heart and
lung, it follows that because the Pterodactyle had the pneumatic
foramina it also had the structures of which they are the evidence,
viz. lung and heart formed on the bird plan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">« 27 »</a></span></p>

<p>Thus Pterodactyles have a nervous system of the bird type.
That kind of brain only exists in association with a four-celled
heart and hot blood.</p>

<p>They have a respiratory organization which is only met with
among birds.</p>

<p>With that respiratory apparatus is always associated a four-celled
heart and hot blood, which it would necessarily
produce.</p>

<p>And with that respiratory organization is always associated a
brain of the type that the Pterodactyle is found to possess.</p>

<p><i>Therefore it is firmly indicated that the general plan of the
most vital and important of the soft structures was similar to that
of living birds.</i></p>

<p>This proposition will be incidentally proved in the following
memoir, in which it will be seen that with such a common plan,
is associated a diversity of details sufficient to demonstrate that
these animals are not birds, but constitute a new group of vertebrata
of equal value with the birds&mdash;the sub-class, Ornithosauria.</p>

STERNUM.<br />
<br />
<a href="#p_i">Pl. 1, fig. 1.</a>
</div>


<p>The Sternum is the key to the bony apparatus supporting the
anterior limbs. In the Pterodactyles from the Cambridge Greensand
it has been well figured and described by Professor Owen,
who enunciated its resemblance to the sternum of birds. The
sternum in Pterodactyles from the Lithographic Slate, shows its
proportional size to the body. The examples found in the Cambridge
Greensand have as yet shown no evidence of a composite
character like that attributed to Rhamphorhynchus Gemmingi.</p>

<p>The sternum consists of an expanded symmetrical shield
having its lateral halves, which are inclined to each other at a
large angle (about 150°), contracted superiorly, behind and immediately
below the synovial cavities for the coracoids. The
vertical angular ridge in which the lateral portions of the sternum
unite becomes elevated as it is followed anteriorly, into a strong
keel. This keel or interpectoral process is highest in front of
the articulations for the coracoids; but the degree of elevation
varies with the species. It is prolonged upward and in front of
the coracoids for some distance, becoming very massive, and the
prolonged mass which is flattened from side to side, reaches
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">« 29 »</a></span>
laterally to the outer margins of the coracoid articulations, and
on the visceral side a little between and over them. The anterior
crest of the keel shows the attachment of powerful muscles.</p>

<p>Professor Owen has observed that only in birds are distinct
synovial cavities provided for the coracoids, and that no reptile
has a sternum showing characters like those seen in the Pterodactyle.
These coracoid cavities are placed as in birds, close
together, behind the <i>manubrium</i>, which forms the hindermost part
of the keel. They are convex transversely, concave from front to
back as in birds, and look upward at an angle of 35°, their main
direction being outward and a little backward. Professor Owen
recognises the function of the shield-shaped sternum in relation to
the mechanism of respiration on the one hand, and on the other
hand, for the attachment of pectoral muscles of great bulk and
strength.</p>

<p>As is well known, the muscles of the breast in most birds
consist chiefly of the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd pectoral muscles, and the
coraco-brachialis.</p>

<p>The peculiar form of the bird's sternum appears to be due to
the vertical development of the second pectoral muscle, since
when the 1st and 3rd muscles are dissected off, the appearance
presented nearly resembles that of the sternum in Pterodactyles.
There can however be no doubt but that the third pectoral muscle,
which in most birds is but feebly developed, attained a far
greater bulk in the Pterodactyle, because there is evidence of its
powerful insertion in the distal anterior face of the coracoid, as
well as of the great lateral extension of the sternal shield to which
such a muscle must&mdash;by the analogy of birds&mdash;have been attached.
The peculiar lateral emargination of the sternum appears to be
due to the anterior sternal termination of this muscle, caused
by the outward direction of the coracoid bone.</p>

<p>Since the coracoids were developed outward and backward so
much more than in birds, it would happen, from the apparent
different direction of the second pectoral muscle, that the first
pectoral muscle which in birds skirts the furculum, must have
passed over the coracoid, probably pulling on its inside in opposition
to the third pectoral. Either a subdivision of this muscle or a
distinct muscle in the same place, in function corresponding to the
subclavius muscle, appears to have been powerfully attached from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">« 30 »</a></span>
the anterior prolongation of the keel of the sternum to the front
face of the coracoid. It is improbable that the second pectoral
muscle was undeveloped, but merely directed differently to what
it is in birds, since, as will be seen, there is a process at the
proximal end of the coracoid homologous with that which forms
the pulley round which this muscle in birds works.</p>

<p>Professor Owen concludes his remarks by observing that the
Pterosaurian breast-bone is in the main formed on the ornithic
type. The muscles also appear to be similar to those of birds.</p>

<p>All the specimens are much mutilated, but all show the distinctive
post-coracoid lateral emarginations, but as these are not
seen in German Pterodactyles they are to be regarded as characters
of a peculiar sub-order and not as characteristics of the sub-class.</p>

<p>The example figured in this memoir and by Professor Owen is
2<sup>5</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inches in antero-posterior measurement, probably about one
third its entire length.</p>

<p>A small example in the collection of Mr Reed of York extends
1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inch in the same measurement, and by the analogy of <i>P.
suevicus</i> was more than twice that length when perfect. It is
remarkable in that the coracoid facets look much less outward
and much more backward than in the larger species.</p>

<p>The mammalian sternum is usually in many consecutive pieces
like the vertebral column. The types in which it attains any size
as an expanded shield are Cetaceans and the Manatee, but in these
groups it has no keel and is not connected with the other bones of
the pectoral girdle. The proximal portion of the sternum of the
Mole is elongated and bird-like, with the shield narrower than in
the typical gallinaceous birds, and with the keel similarly developed.
It is connected with the humerus by small sub-quadrate
bones named clavicles placed at the sides of the proximal end.
The sternum in Bats usually consists of a proximal and a distal
part. It is narrow except at the proximal-termination where it
widens like the letter T or Y; and to the sides of the lateral
prolongations are attached the long, slender, curved bones named
clavicles, and a pair of ribs. This sternum develops a bird-like
keel. Both Mole and Bat are regarded as differing from Pterodactyles
in the bone giving attachment to the clavicles instead
of to the coracoids. The proximal part of the sternum in both
the living animals, gives attachment to but one pair of sternal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">« 31 »</a></span>
ribs. The Pterodactyle sternum otherwise differs from the Bats
in having the articulations for the coracoids close together, of a
peculiar concavo-convex character, with a massive portion or keel
prolonged forward in front of the coracoid articulations. The Bat
cannot be said to resemble the Pterodactyle closely. The sternum
of the Mole differs from that of the Pterodactyle in having a less
developed shield, and in having a more developed keel which is not
prolonged in front of the coracoid articulations. These examples
demonstrate that resemblance in conformation is functional, and
no proof of affinity.</p>

<p>Pterodactyles make some approach in the proportions of their
sternum to Struthious birds. But the Struthionidæ have the bone
thick, do not develop a keel, nor, have they an inter-coracoid process
while the coracoid articulations are singularly long and narrow
instead of being ovate. With other birds the Pterodactyle sternum
agrees in giving attachment to the coracoid bones by synovial
articulations, in the bone being shield-shaped, and supporting a more
or less developed keel. The keel is chiefly developed at the proximal
end, as in the Albatross, which has the bone broad; and it is
prolonged in front of the coracoids exactly as in <i>Mergus merganser</i>,
which sternum if a little broader in the shield and thicker in the
keel would very nearly reproduce the sternum of the Pterodactyle,
even to the "post-coracoid lateral emargination" of Cambridge
specimens. Among reptiles the only form which suggests comparison
is the Chameleon, in which however the sternum consists of an
anterior and a posterior part as in the Bats, the back part narrow,
and the front part a long lozenge shape, with a keel made by inclination
of the sides of the bone to each other as in the Dodo, but
the keel such as it is, is at the back part of the bone, and there is
no prolongation in front of the coracoids as in Pterodactyle. The
coracoids are broad, and are applied to the two anterior sides
of the lozenge. The Crocodile has a narrow flat sternum which is
prolonged anteriorly between the coracoids.</p>

<p>The resemblance is greater with mammals than with reptiles.
From birds the Pterodactyle sternum makes no essential difference,
and in the Merganser finds a close ally.</p>

CORACOID.<br />
<br />
<a href="#p_ii">Pl. 2, fig. 1-6.</a>
</div>

<p>Commonly the coracoid in the Cambridge Pterodactyles is
anchylosed to the scapula: occasionally the bones are separate,
though the separation has hitherto only been observed in the
largest species. In 1851 Professor Owen, when figuring the
anchylosed ends of the scapula and coracoid in Pterodactylus giganteus
(Bowerbank), observed that in no part of the skeleton does the
Pterodactyle more nearly resemble a bird than in the scapular arch;
a view again urged emphatically in 1859 when similar fragments
were described from the Cambridge Greensand. Since then perfect
examples of the coracoid have occurred, which show the characters
given in the following description.</p>

<p>The bone is long, with sub-parallel sides, sub-triangnlar in
section, with the proximal end expanded exteriorly and posteriorly,
resembling in form the coracoid of a bird. The front surface looks
forward and outward; it is flattened, is a little convex transversely,
and a little convex in length; it is rugose with muscular attachments,
which terminate in a tubercle on the uppermost fourth of
the front, usually near to the inner side. The middle third of the
slightly concave inside margin of the front aspect, is sharply angular;
the parts above and below it have the angularity rounded
off. The outside margin, a little more concave than the inside
margin, is sharply angular in its distal third, in which the front
gradually widens to near the sternal articulation, when it contracts&mdash;the
whole sternal termination of the bone being directed a little
inward towards the manubrium of the sternum. The inside, which
faces the opposite coracoid, is convex transversely in the lower
half or two-thirds; its distal termination is carried inward. The
expanded proximal end of the inside is flattened, or channelled, by
the developement inwardly, at the proximal end of the ridge
formed with the front side, of a long strong process homologous
with that on the inner side of the coracoid in birds. The channel so
formed rounds on to the proximal surface of the bone, and extends
backward to the limit of the scapula; over it the second pectoral
muscle may be presumed to have worked<a name="FNanchor_14" id="FNanchor_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[N]</a>. The third side of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">« 33 »</a></span>
bone is much more concave in length than either of the others; it
looks backward, outward, and downward, the proximal end being
turned outward and downward more than the distal end; it is a little
concave transversely at the expanded proximal end. Near the distal
end there are sometimes visible a few faint marks of the insertion
of muscular fibres, but they are much less distinct than those
made by the coraco-brachialis muscle in the corresponding region
of the coracoid in birds. Throughout its length it rounds into
the inner side, and the upper third rounds convexly into the front.
On the most posterior part of this aspect of the proximal end is a
groove terminating in a long pneumatic foramen, partly in the
coracoid, partly in the scapula.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_14" id="Footnote_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14"><span class="label">[N]</span></a> The homologous process is more developed in Pterodactylus giganteus.
See f. 7. pl. <span class="smcap">XXXI.</span> Owen, Cret. Rept.</p></div>

<p>The muscular attachments on the front aspect of the coracoid
appear to be two; one large and long inserted into the inner half
of the middle third of the bone, terminating at the proximal end
in a tubercle. No specimen shows the distal end of the insertion.
This may indicate a subdivision of the first pectoral muscle. The
other insertion, if it be distinct, is long and much narrower and at
the distal end of the bone. This, according to the analogy of birds,
should be the third pectoral muscle; if the insertion should be but
part of that to which it is distally adjacent, then the third pectoral
muscle must have had an enormous developement unparalleled
in birds.</p>

<p>The distal end of the bone terminates in a synovial articulation
concave transversely, convex from front to back, in form transversely
ovate: the narrow side of the articulation, like the thin edge
of the coracoid, being exterior. The articulation is about three
fourths of the transverse diameter of the distal end; it is at right
angles with the long axis of the bone, and looks downward and
a little backward.</p>

<p>The proximal end, massively enlarged outward and backward,
presents on the proximal surface three well defined regions. The
largest of these is an irregular flattened surface half ovate in form,
inclined to the axis of the bone at about 45°, looking backward,
and upward also, when the bone is held vertically; the mesial
hindermost half of the radius of this area is occupied by a pneumatic
cavity: to this surface is applied the scapula. The next
largest surface is rectangular and oblong, looking upward, outward,
and a little forward. The transverse aspect which looks outward
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">« 34 »</a></span>
being nearly half as long again as the antero-posterior aspect which
looks forward; in the latter direction the area is slightly concave,
in the former direction it is slightly convex; its posterior boundary
is parallel with the front of the bone: this area forms the anterior
moiety of the glenoid cavity, to which the proximal end of the
humerus is applied.</p>

<p>The remaining surface of the proximal end is sub-quadrate,
adjoins the two other surfaces as well as the front and the inside
of the shaft, it is conically concave.</p>

<p>The entire bone when applied to the sternum looked outward,
backward and upward.</p>

<p>Professor Owen remarked (1859) that the "coracoid is shorter
and straighter in birds than in Pterodactyles, but is commonly
broader, and with a longer and stronger anterior process."</p>

<p>The points in which the Pterodactyle coracoid resembles that
of birds (e. g. Gallinaceæ) are the long slender triangular shaft; the
concavo-convex articulation to the sternum; the convexity of the
distal end in front, and its concavity behind; the posterior aspect
of its scapular surface, and the pneumatic foramen.</p>

<p>The points in which it is distinct from birds are that the bone
is not produced proximally beyond the glenoid cavity for the humerus,
which, instead of being lateral as in birds, and looking outward,
in Pterodactyles forms the proximal-termination of the bone.
The sternal articulation is proportionally much shorter transversely
in Pterodactyles, terminating in a convex margin which rounds up
into the thin outer margin, as in the immature coracoid of the common
Cock. It is bow-shaped in front instead of being straight, and
is commonly longer than in birds. The usual ossified connection
with the scapula is not entirely unparalleled in birds, the whole
pectoral girdle being sometimes anchylosed into a bony mass as in
the frigate bird.</p>

<p>In the monotremata, the only mammals in which the coracoids
are separate bones, they rather recall those of Ichthyosaurus than
those of any other animals, and have no connection with the
sternum. The bone which represents it functionally in placental
mammals is the clavicle.</p>

<p>In no reptile is there any structure resembling the Ornithosaurian
coracoid. The nearest approximation is made by the
Crocodile, in which as in the Chameleon the pectoral girdle is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">« 35 »</a></span>
formed as in pterodactyles and struthious birds by scapula, coracoid
and sternum. But in the Crocodile the coracoid is compressed,
and expanded from side to side both proximally and distally.
Distally it has no synovial articulation with the sternum; and
proximally a wide process of the bone extends beyond the articulation
for the humerus as in birds, only the scapula unites with
the prolonged part, and the glenoid cavity looks forward and inward.</p>

<p>The coracoid is essentially avian in its affinities, though with
peculiar characters of its own. In the German genera it closely
resembles specimens from the Cambridge Greensand.</p>

<p>23 specimens are exhibited. Nos. 4, 10, 12, are the middle parts
of shafts of left coracoids. Nos. 3-12, 22, are the middle parts of
shafts of right coracoids. Nos. 2, 5, 14, are proximal ends of left
coracoids. Nos. 1, 6, 8, 9, 23, are proximal ends of right coracoids.
Nos. 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, are distal ends of left coracoids.
No. 13 is a nearly perfect left coracoid, and No. 7 is the glenoid
cavity for the humerus formed by a right coracoid with the
anchylosed scapula.</p>

SCAPULA.<br />
<br />
<a href="#p_i">Pl. 1, figs. 2-12.</a>
</div>

<p>Professor Owen described the scapula of Pterodactylus giganteus
in 1851, and added further particulars regarding the Species from
the Cambridge Greensand, in 1859; but, as with the coracoid, only
the humeral end has hitherto been figured. The only example
sufficiently perfect to give the length and proportions of the bone
is preserved in the collection of Mr Reed, of York. This left scapula
is a stout strong bone, short in proportion to its strength, of
flattened ovate form in section, expanding at the humeral end into
an irregular sub-rhomboid mass. It is smaller in the middle, contracting
both from side to side and from back to front till the back
to front measurement is <sup>7</sup>/<sub>16</sub> of an inch, and the side to side measurement
is <sup>11</sup>/<sub>16</sub> of an inch, and it expands a little at the free end,
which terminates in a smooth heart-shaped surface, convex in the
long diameter, which measures <sup>7</sup>/<sub>8</sub> of an inch, and flat in the short
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">« 36 »</a></span>
one, which measures nearly <sup>5</sup>/<sub>8</sub> of an inch; it is at right angles with
the inside of the bone. The sharp superior lateral outline is concave,
but less so than  the inferior lateral outline; into that inferior
aspect of the bone the sides are more fully rounded. The flattened
inner surface applied to the ribs is concave in the length of the
bone, which measures 3<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inches; the posterior half of which is convex
transversely, the anterior humeral half is concave transversely
so as to be cup-shaped, and measures in extreme width 1<sup>11</sup>/<sub>16</sub> inch;
the outline of the transversely convex outer side in length is nearly
straight, but the exterior part and glenoid cavity of the proximal
end is broken away, and there only remains a small median proximal
surface broken at both ends, a little concave in length, measuring
<sup>5</sup>/<sub>8</sub> of an inch, and convex in breadth measuring <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> of an inch.</p>

<p>As there is no specimen in the Woodwardian Museum showing
clearly the connection of the proximal with the distal end, the
specimens are arranged on separate tablets.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Humeral End of Scapula.</span></p>

<p>The humeral end of the scapula exhibits in the different
species much diversity of form, spreading laterally from the shaft,
and terminating in an elongated articular surface truncating the
bone nearly at right angles. On its inferior border it throws out a
large convex tuberosity, separated from the humeral articular
surface by a deep emargination. From the tuberosity usually
arises a crescentic row of muscular insertions, which is continued
inward and forward over the most compressed part of the scapula
towards the middle of the humeral articulation. From the superior
margin, interior to the coracoid, arises a prominent ridge,
the spine of the scapula, which is directed diagonally backward
and downward, terminating in the middle of the outer surface,
where it is bordered on the anterior aspect by a long narrow muscular
attachment. Between this spine and the elevated margin
of the glenoid cavity the bone is much compressed and concave.</p>

<p>On the inside surface of the bone there appear to be small
muscular attachments in front of and behind the great tuberosity.
The area between the spine and the inner surface is sometimes
flattened, sometimes gently convex.</p>

<p>With well-marked distinctive characters in the inferior tuberosity,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">« 37 »</a></span>
the pre-tuberous emargination and the thick rounded form
of the bone, the Pterodactyle scapula is intermediate in character
between that of a mole, a bird, and the crocodile; wanting the
sabre shape of the bird's scapula, it also wants the wide expanded
form of the scapula of the Crocodile, but resembles the latter in
the direction and degree of developement of the spine. This
modification is probably due to the outward direction and clavicular
function of the coracoid, as well as to the raptorial habit of
the organism.</p>

<p>In no living Reptile is there a scapula to be compared with
that of the Pterodactyle, for besides the free end being expanded,
in the crocodile, it is also thin and squamous and the bone makes
a continuous curve with the coracoid as in struthious birds, and
not a sharp angle as in Pterodactyles. The "spine" in crocodiles
is on the anterior border of the bone and directed upward and
backward, while in Pterodactyles it is on the posterior border and
directed upward and forward. In the Chameleon the scapula is
more elongated and narrow, narrower in proportion to its length
than in Pterodactyle, but becomes rapidly wide at its union with
the coracoid. It is curved in length so as to fit on to convex ribs.
A scapula presenting some resemblance to Pterodactyle is found
in certain Liassic Ichthyosaurs.</p>

<p>Among mammals a straight elongated narrow scapula is rare.
The mole however has a scapula of this kind somewhat cylindrical
in its proximal half and not much expanded at the free end, on
which there is a small spine. The anterior emargination above
the glenoid cavity in Pterodactyle is entirely mammalian, as is
the anterior tuberosity above the emargination, for it entirely corresponds
with what in ruminants,  pachyderms and many mammals
would be named the coracoid process. If that process is accurately
determined it is difficult to say what this is.</p>

<p>In birds there is often a prolonged process on the inner side of
the coracoid, which however extends interior to other parts of the
scapula, and to this the furculum is attached. Such traces of a
spine as are to be detected in the swan conform to the Pterodactyle.</p>


<p>No bird has the scapula cylindrical, even struthious birds only
making an approximation to such a condition; and no birds have
the scapula so straight. The bone is more avian and mammalian
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">« 38 »</a></span>
than reptilian; and more avian than mammalian but with strong
distinctive characters of its own.</p>

<p>17 specimens of the humeral ends of scapulæ are exhibited.
Nos. 1, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 13, 14, 15, 17 are left scapulæ. Nos. 2, 3,
5, 10, 12, 16 are right scapulæ.</p>

<p>The tablet of the distal ends of scapulæ comprises 6 specimens.</p>

HUMERUS.<br />
<br />
<a href="#p_iv">Pl. 4.</a>
</div>

<p>There are among the fossils of the Cambridge Greensand at
least two well-marked <i>types</i> of Pterodactyle humerus, readily
recognised by the forms of the proximal and of the distal ends,
and by the positions of the pneumatic foramina. In the group
having the ulnar ridge developed the pneumatic foramen is on the
posterior aspect of the bone<a name="FNanchor_15" id="FNanchor_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[O]</a> under the ulnar ridge, as in birds;
but in some of the small Pterodactyles the foramen is on the
anterior surface, and on its radial side. This latter kind of humerus
has the distal end more or less divided into three convex surfaces,
while the radial crest is enormously developed and terminates in
a smooth oblong flattened surface nearly as large as the proximal
articular surface, and looking anteriorly. The distal articular surfaces
are not as in birds parallel to that of the proximal end,
though they agree with those of birds in being at right angles to
the radial crest; this ridge in Pterodactyles being directed much
further outward and backward than in birds.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_15" id="Footnote_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15"><span class="label">[O]</span></a> Professor Owen states (p. 16, 3d Supt.) that the foramen is palmar.
Fig. 15. T. <span class="smcap">III.</span> 2d Supt. shows it to be anconal.</p></div>

<p>The largest forms of Pterodactyle all have the distal articular
surface flatter, and the proximal articulation less bent back so as
to look more upwards. No specimen of this kind of humerus has
occurred with the radial crest preserved; but it is apparently
carried farther down the shaft and not so far forward as in the
other group. This latter kind of bone is shown by Prof. Owen
in T. <span class="smcap">III.</span> figs. 1, 2, 3rd Sup. Cret. Reptiles; the former kind has
been illustrated in figure 5 of the same plate.</p>

<p>Some of the most gigantic Pterodactyles appear to have had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">« 39 »</a></span>
the limb-bones as solid as those of crocodiles, and unpermeated by
air; and there is no evidence that the high Avian characteristics
of most of these Greensand fossils also pertained to all the previously
known types from the lower secondary rocks.</p>

<p>The osteological series comprises 46 specimens. No. 30 is a
nearly perfect right humerus. Nos. 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 18, 22,
23, 25, 39 are examples of the proximal ends of left humeri.
Nos. 3, 4, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 19, 24, 26, 27, 28, 38, 40, 41
are examples of the proximal ends of right humeri. Nos. 20, 21,
32, 33, 34, 35, 37, 42, 44, 45, are examples of the distal ends of
left humeri. Nos. 29, 31, 36, 43 and 46 are distal ends of right
humeri.</p>

<p>No. 30 shows the entire length of the humerus to be 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inches.
It has a nearly circular shaft with a diameter of a little more than
a quarter of an inch, being more slender than the corresponding
bone of Pt. suevicus, which has the same length. The <i>proximal</i>
articular surface is crescentic, the anterior concavity corresponding
with the concave anterior aspect of the proximal end, while the
convex border corresponds to the convex posterior side of the bone,
which it overhangs: it is worn, but appears to measure half an inch
from the radial to the ulnar side. The ulnar ridge (which is worn)
has not extended more than a quarter of an inch beyond the
articular surface. The thin bird-like radial crest, arising rather
more distally than the ulnar ridge, is flat on its posterior surface,
and extends anteriorly for a distance nearly half as far again as
the length of the proximal articular surface of the humerus. On
the proximal third of the posterior face are two contiguous long
narrow oblique muscular insertions. The proximal ends Nos. 22,
23, 24, 25 are examples of this kind of bone, having the pneumatic
foramen radially situated on the anterior aspect near to the
articular surface, as may be seen in No. 24. No. 25 shows the termination
of the radial crest in an oblique oblong smooth surface,
slightly convex in length and breadth, directed distally towards
the ulnar side.</p>

<p>No. 6, 7, 13, 27, are examples of another kind of proximal end,
where the pneumatic foramen is an oval hole on the ulnar side of
the posterior surface. The radial crest arises more distally, and
the ulnar ridge more proximally, than in the small species, like
No. 30.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">« 40 »</a></span></p>

<p>Nos. 4, 11, 14, 16 are examples of other species with the foramen
placed as in the last group, only less near to the proximal
end, while it enters obliquely, being directed distally from the
broad concave area proximal to it. The largest proximal ends
known, such as No. 2, which though very imperfect measures 2<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub>
inches over what remains of the articular surface, appear to conform
to this latter type.</p>

<p><i>Distally</i> the humerus No. 30 enlarges, widening rapidly on
the radial side, which is bordered near the distal end by a sharp
ridge showing a muscular attachment, while the ulnar side is
rounded and rather inflated. The articular surface looks downward
and in the direction of the radial process. There is a mesial
concavity on the radial side which is bordered on the right and on
the left by a prominent rounded condyle, and behind by a condyloid
convexity. On that side which in conformity with the
nomenclature applied to birds' bones, has here been named the
ulnar side, the ulnar and mesial condyles are impressed with a
flattened slightly concave sub-rhomboid area, which looks downward,
backward, and towards the ulnar side. These characters
are not well seen in No. 30, but may be effectively studied in their
specific variations in Nos. 36, 37, 42, 43, 44, 45, and 46.</p>

<p>Nos. 20, 21, 29, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, are examples of the distal
ends of humeri of a different type. They are mostly larger than
the preceding group, and correspond in characters with the large
proximal ends, but appear to be separable into two groups, namely
those with a pneumatic foramen on the anterior radial side near
to the articular surface, and those where no pneumatic foramen is
seen. Unlike the previously considered type, the ulnar side is
sometimes more inflated than the radial side.</p>

<p>The mesial condyle in this group appears in every case to be an
epiphysis, which is wanting. The radial condyle becomes a large
flattened slightly convex surface looking downwards, which in some
of the species, as Nos. 21 and 32 (in other respects remarkable
species), shows an approach to a trochlear character on its anterior
side. In Nos. 33, 34 and 35 the mesial anterior concavity becomes
flattened and abuts at an angle against the flattened radial condyle.
No. 20 shows the rhomboid impression on the ulnar side to be more
concave and more ovate. The ulnar condyle remains a smaller but
prominent tubercle directed distally. Nos. 21, 22 and 34 show a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">« 41 »</a></span>
ridge developed on the ulnar side of the shaft like that on the radial
side in the other group, while the radial ridge is not so near to the
articular surface. The largest and smallest distal ends of humeri
known, both show the characters here enumerated. The great
distal end of a left humerus, figured by Prof. Owen, Pl. <span class="smcap">IV.</span> f. 1, 2,
3 of the 1st Supplement to the Cretaceous Pterosauria, is of this
kind, and though imperfect measures more than three inches over
what remains of the articular surface. In the small humerus,
No. 30, the width over the distal articular surface is <sup>5</sup>/<sub>8</sub>ths of an inch.
If it is assumed that the large bone was no more than 5 times the
length of the small one, the entire length of the humerus would
have been about twelve inches. The smallest humerus, No. 29,
measures over the shaft rather more than one eighth of an inch.</p>

<p>The Ornithosaurian humerus has but little in common with
that of any mammal. Most mammals have the proximal head of
the bone hemispherical, and a pit at the distal end for the olecranon
process of the ulna, while there is usually little indication of a radial
crest, and the proximal and distal ends are in the same plane. In
the Bat however the bone is twisted a little so that the slight radial
crest looks in the same direction as the distal end, here also there
is no pit for the olecranon; but the bone is sigmoid and proportionally
much longer than in Pterodactyles. In the horse, hippopotamus,
&amp;c., the radial process becomes more developed but never
resembles that of a Pterodactyle.</p>

<p>Among reptiles, the bone may be compared with lizards and
crocodiles. In crocodiles the proximal and distal ends are nearly
in the same plane, the distal end has two condyles, the head is
convex from side to side, and the radial crest is moderately
developed and never extends so far outward or so far proximally
as in Pterodactyle. In the Chameleon the bone is more twisted
than in Crocodile, and as in Pterodactyle the distal end is compressed
on the radial side to a sharp margin. In Iguana, Scink,
and Monitor both proximal and distal ends are much expanded,
and the radial process makes no approximation to that of a
Pterodactyle.</p>

<p>The bird humerus does not approximate more closely in form
to that of the Pterodactyle than does the Chameleon humerus,
though it has the cardinal distinction of pneumatic foramina, and
these sometimes corresponding in position in the two groups.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">« 42 »</a></span></p>

<p>The bird humerus is commonly longer, though in the parrots
the proportions and straightness are not unlike Pterodactyle. In
some respects a nearer resemblance is seen in the raptorial bird
<i>Gypogeranus serpentarius</i>, in which the radial process is rather
more developed than in the Crocodile, and extends further proximally
though still much smaller than in Pterodactyle; here too the
superior surface is concave from side to side, and the distal articulation
is not unlike that of some Pterodactyles. But no Pterodactyle
has the head of the humerus convex from the radial to the
ulnar sides, and the bird is distinctive in having the ulnar crest
developed on the inferior side of the head: a faint approximation to
a similar development is seen in Crocodile, but there is no trace of
such a process in Pterodactyle. The distal end is more Bird-like
than Lacertian in form, but is twisted to a greater angle with the
proximal end than in birds.</p>

<p>Altogether the bone is distinctive. The points in which it is
unlike birds and reptiles are those in which Birds and Lizards resemble
each other; it would not be easy to say that in form it resembles
one group more than the other. But it is linked with
birds by the pneumatic foramina.</p>

RADIUS AND ULNA.
</div>

<p>Of neither of these bones has a perfect specimen been found.
While fragments of humeri are met with frequently, fragments
of these bones are rare. In accordance with the analogy with birds
the Ulna might be presumed to be the larger bone of the two.
But from a study of German specimens the larger bone is found to
be the Radius, which according to the mammalian plan is placed in
front of the ulna. As a whole, the fore-arm of Ornithosaurians is
only to be compared with the insectivorous mammal <i>Chrysochloris
Capensis</i>, in which there are also three bones in the fore-arm,&mdash;the
third bone like the <i>Pteroid bone</i> in Ornithosaurians, extending
about half-way from the carpus to the humerus, and holding, relatively,
a similar position and development to the fibula in bats.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">« 43 »</a></span></p>

<p>The pteroid bone articulated with a separate carpal, and was
placed on the side of the arm, adjacent to the radius, which at
the distal end extended in German specimens more inward than
the ulna. In Chrysochloris the third bone appears to be behind
the other bones, and adjacent to the ulna<a name="FNanchor_16" id="FNanchor_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[P]</a>.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_16" id="Footnote_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16"><span class="label">[P]</span></a> See D'Alton and Pander <i>Chiropteren und Insectivoren</i>, Bonn, 1831, pl. 5,
Chrysochloris.</p></div>

<p>Among neither birds nor reptiles is any comparable modification
of the fore-arm to be found. Then by examining the proximal
surface of the proximal carpal, the characters of the distal end of
the Radius are readily discovered. The proximal carpal shows on
the same surface another articular facets with which however only
one fragmentary distal end of a bone corresponds. That accordingly
is identified as the ulna. Besides these, three other articular
ends of bones occur, one of which fits on to the distal end of the
femur. The remaining two are both large bones, with epiphyses
which formed portions of the articular surfaces, and are usually
wanting. One of these bones corresponds in form with the ulna of
a bird, and would fit the facet on the ulnar side of the distal end
of the Pterodactyle humerus. The other bone is massive with a
sub-quadrate articular end, and might well be the proximal end of
the radius. Some specimens are among the largest fragments of
Pterodactyle bone known. The only other bone that either of
these could be is the distal end of the tibia, a bone not yet known,
but probably not unlike that of a bird.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">I. Distal End of Ulna.</span></p>

<p>Four specimens which show articular ends such as the ulna
should have, are mounted together. They are compressed bones
with the section of the fracture elongately oval; and the shaft
widens from the fracture to the articulation without increasing
in thickness. The outer surface is gently convex, becoming concave
mesially near the articulation; the inner surface has the
same characters, only the concavity at the extreme distal end
reaches from side to side of the bone. The two short sides both
look outward as well as laterally; one of them flattened so as to
thicken the bone, is concave in vertical outline owing to the extreme
distal end turning suddenly outward; the other side a little convex,
compresses the bone and inflects its inner margin. The longest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">« 44 »</a></span>
specimen measures 1<sup>5</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch; <sup>5</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch wide at the fracture, and
1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch wide at the distal end. The greatest thickness at the
distal end is half an inch, the thickness of the fractured shaft
is <sup>5</sup>/<sub>8</sub> of an inch.</p>

<p>The articular surface appears to have an elongated sub-reniform
shape, the part at the compressed side of the bone being
narrower than the broad ovate part on the thick side of the bone,
to the lateral limit of which it extends, while the narrow part
does not extend laterally nearly so far as the inflected border,
which appears to give attachment to powerful muscles. There is
also a strong muscular attachment at the corresponding diagonal
corner of the bone where the outer surface on its right meets the
side of the bone in an elevated ridge.</p>

<p>In its long diameter the articulation is a little convex; transversely
it is very convex in the ovate part, but more flattened in
its narrower continuation. Where widest it measures about <sup>4</sup>/<sub>10</sub>ths
of an inch.</p>

<p>Nos. 5 and 6 on another tablet appear to be distal ends
of ulna of another kind of Pterodactyle. They are less compressed,
more quadrate in section, and have the sides more nearly
parallel The flattened side similarly has a concave border, but
instead of having its distal termination developed laterally, has it
thickened behind. The opposite side of the bone which in the
other specimens was compressed is here thick and well rounded,
and not at all inflected. There is an absence of the concavity
noticed on the outer surface of the bone in the compressed specimens.
The articular surface is much flatter, and a little concave
in length instead of being convex; as in the other examples it
looks downward. The largest fragment. No. 5, measures 1<sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch
long; it is <sup>6</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch wide at the fracture, and <sup>4</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch thick. The
sub-quadrate distal end is more than an inch long, more than
<sup>4</sup>/<sub>8</sub>ths inch thick on the thick side, and nearly <sup>4</sup>/<sub>8</sub>ths inch thick on the
compressed side.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">II. Distal End of Radius.</span></p>

<p>The best preserved of the 10 specimens here exhibited is
3 inches long, No. 2. The shaft is oval, flattened on one side;
measuring at an inch from the fractured end <sup>7</sup>/<sub>10</sub>ths of an inch in
the least diameter, and one inch in the wide diameter. It widens
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">« 45 »</a></span>
distally at first slowly, then rapidly, till at the articular end its
greatest width is two inches. But while expanding laterally it
contracts from side to side, the more convex side of the two at
about an inch from the articular end, beginning to approximate
to the flatter side till the articular end has a short diameter of
less than half an inch.</p>

<p>On the left-hand corner of the convex inner side of the bone
is an elevated flattened disc for muscular attachments, fully half
an inch in diameter, there is a slight muscular attachment interior
to this, nearer the middle of the bone. The left-hand corner
of the flattened outer side of the distal end of the radius
is marked by a vertical ridge bordering a similarly elevated oval
muscular attachment. Parallel to this nearer the middle of the
side is a much stronger and acutely elevated ridge.</p>

<p>The articulation is made up of three distinct parts, all in a
straight line. The portion of bone adjacent to the large muscular
disc is compressed and rounded on the distal end; then first there is
a rather deep circular cup <sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub>ths of an inch wide, nearer to the more
convex than to the flatter side of the bone; adjacent to this cup is
a convex ball of about the same size; while the remainder of the
articulation is concave in length, convex from side to side, and
looks downward and a little towards the inner convex side of the
bone. The specimens are arranged so as to display these characters.&mdash;The
example described is of nearly the same size as that
figured for the humerus in fig. 1, T. <span class="smcap">XXIV.</span> of the Cretaceous Reptilia.
The less well preserved bone in that figure exhibits the
Ulna in its true position behind the Radius.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">III. Proximal End of Ulna.</span></p>

<p>This bone has much the proportions of the Ulna in birds, the
smaller specimens nearly resembling the ulna of the Heron. The
specimen (No. 1) with the shaft best preserved is 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inches long,
cylindrical at the fracture, where it measures in diameter <sup>3</sup>/<sub>16</sub>ths of
an inch. It gradually enlarges proximally widening to about <sup>7</sup>/<sub>10</sub>ths
of an inch; near the proximal end it is a little curved, the side
which is concave in length being a little flattened, while there is
a lateral elevation on the opposite side, apparently corresponding to
the quill-ridge on the convex side of the bird-ulna. There is a
separate ossification for the olecranon, which is an irregular sub-oblong
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">« 46 »</a></span>
bone forming the outer part of the articulation; it is only
preserved in No. 1. Nos. 4, 5 and 6 show the concave transverse
groove from which it has come away.</p>

<p>The articular surface looks upward and forward, in which
aspect it has a trapezoidal form. Sometimes, as in No. 2, the
great sigmoid area is divided into two parts by a vertical ridge, the
more elevated part of the articulation on the radial side of the
bone being concave, while the outer part, as in the heron, besides
being concave, has its border on the concave side of the bone produced
and rounded. There is a small triangular elevation on the
radial aspect of the proximal end like that on the corresponding
part of the ulna of the heron. On this aspect the bone is flattened,
on the opposite and outward aspect it is compressed and
produced as in the bird. No. 2 measures 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch over the articular
end. The series includes 6 specimens.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">IV. Proximal End of Radius.</span></p>

<p>This bone terminated in an epiphysis which formed part of the
articular surface, and has disappeared from all the 7 specimens
mounted. So much of the articulation as remains does not oppose
the idea of its having been attached to the humerus, while the
large size of the example No. 7, which could not have measured
less than 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inches from side to side over the articulation, is more
in accordance with what is at present known of the dimensions
attained by the distal end of the humerus than with the size that
would be expected in the distal end of the tibia, which is the only
other unknown bone to which these specimens could be referred.</p>

<p>The longest specimen, No. 3, is 3 inches long; broadly ovate at
the fracture, measuring in the long diameter 1 inch, and in the
short diameter more than <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub>ths of an inch. Nearer the articular end
the bone becomes in section sub-quadrate or rather sub-rhomboid.
No. 1 shows these terminal characters extremely well. On the
posterior aspect of the specimen the surface is divided into two
flattened slightly convex parts by a median vertical well-rounded
angular bend. In front the side is similarly divided into two
parts, both of them a little concave proximally, by a sharp median
vertical ridge, which does not reach to the articulation by a
varying distance, never so long as the bone is wide. The ridge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">« 47 »</a></span>
terminates in, and is pierced by, a vertical groove apparently for a
nutritive vessel. Where the anterior and posterior aspects of the
bone converge laterally the sides are well rounded.</p>

<p>Only a small part of the articular surface is preserved, looking
upward and a little forward; it terminates the wider of the halves
of the bone laterally and in front. The remainder of the articular
surface, from which the epiphysis has come away, may be divided
principally in the majority of specimens into a posterior flattened
median rhomboid space and an oblong cup-shaped anterior space
divided from it by an elevated ridge. The extreme lateral termination
appears to have been a ball-shaped convexity.</p>

<p>The great length of the fore-arm relatively to the humerus,
characteristic of German Ornithosaurians, from the fragmentary
condition of Cambridge specimens is not seen.</p>

<p>Although the fore-arm resembles Chrysochloris in <i>plan</i> the resemblance
is not close in the details of form. In many Mammals
it is characteristic for the radius to be the principal bone of the
fore-arm, and among Ruminants in which this is especially the case
the radius is altogether in front and the ulna behind as is the position
with Birds and Crocodiles. And among mammals with claws,
as in the Lion, Bear, &amp;c., and in the Chameleon, it is characteristic,
for the radius also to be on the inside of the limb at the distal end,
as in Ornithosaurians. In form, ridges, and muscular attachments
(see pl. 3) the distal end of the radius approximates closely to the
Bear and the Lion, and may also be compared with the Bats and
Birds, though with Birds it is a small bone. From the epiphysis
of the proximal end apparently being wanting it would be difficult
to compare closely. But though not like any particular mammal,
it might have pertained to a mammal since it has the large
perforation for the nutritive vessel near to the proximal end as
in the Camel and many of the mammalia.</p>

<p>The ulna of the Pterodactyles is at the proximal end altogether
distinguished from mammals by the slight development of the olecranon,
nor can the distal end, especially in its relation to the carpus,
be paralleled.</p>

<p>Among birds and reptiles the ulna is the large bone, and here
a general resemblance in form to the ulna of Pterodactyles is seen
at the proximal end. It is not compressed from side to side as in
the Crocodile, Iguana, Monitor, &amp;c., but from back to fronts in this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">« 48 »</a></span>
rather resembling Birds than the Chameleon. It however at the
distal end is more crocodilian.</p>

<p>The fore-arm in plan is mammalian. The Pteroid bone is
mammalian, the Radius is mammalian and avian; the Ulna is
avian, and crocodilian in form, but mammalian in proportion.
The pneumatic foramen of the ulna is peculiarly avian.</p>

CARPUS.<br />
<br />
<a href="#p_v">Pl. 5.</a>
</div>

<p>The pterodactyle wrist is made up of three bones, arranged as
a proximal carpal, a distal carpal, and a lateral carpal. Two of
them are figured by Professor Owen, who regarded the distal carpal
of this description as the scapho-cuneiform; while A very imperfect
example of the proximal carpal is named the unciform:
neither of these determinations, the reverse of those which follow,
were given as more than probable guesses.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">I. Proximal Carpal.</span></p>

<p>No. 10 shows the proximal surface well; portions of it are seen
in Nos. 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 11, and 12. The distal surface is best exhibited
in No. 1; portions of it are shown in Nos. 2, 3, 5, 7, 8.
No. 13 is an impression taken from the proximal surface of a distal
carpal to show its correspondence with distal surface of the proximal
carpal. The bone is proximally of an irregular oblong form,
being five sided, and much broader towards the inner end than
towards the outer end. The two ends are sub-parallel, and rather
obliquely connected on one side by a nearly straight border more
than twice as long as the shorter end. The other limits of the sub-parallel
ends are connected by two concave borders meeting in a
well rounded convexity, which is near to the broader inner end.</p>

<p>The proximal surface of the bone is flattened, and may be divided
into a sub-rhomboid space, adjacent to the shorter of the sub-parallel
ends, which is moderately concave in the long axis of the
bone and slightly convex transversely, and an oblong space adjacent
to the longer of the two ends. This is separated from the sub-rhomboid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">« 49 »</a></span>
space, toward the straight side of the bone, by an elevated
ridge sub-parallel with the ends. It is directed towards the
convexity on the opposite side, in which the long and short concave
parts meet, but after half crossing the bone it becomes forked
in a U shape, and less elevated; the smooth unarticular included
space shows an oval pneumatic foramen, which varies in size with
the different species. The region between this Y-shaped ridge
and the longer of the two ends, is sub-reniform, slightly concave in
its long diameter, and deeply concave in the short diameter, exactly
corresponding in form with the articular surface already described
as the distal end of the ulna. Also parallel with the long end of
the bone are marks of an articular surface exactly corresponding
with those described as the distal end of the radius; that is, at the
convex angle of the angulated side is placed a hemispherical boss,'
interior to which is a hemispherical concavity, and extending toward
the straight side is the oblique smooth border of the sub-rhomboid
area described. There still remains a space to be accounted for.
This consists of a sub-quadrate area forming the corner of the bone
made by the concave side and the shorter outer end; it is
made up of an inner concave part separated from the radial articulation
by a ridge, and an outer convex part constituting the
shorter end of the bone.</p>

<p>This carpal is moderately compressed from the proximal to the
distal side, except towards the shorter end of the bone, being
there prolonged distally into a wedge-shaped process, showing at
its termination marks of a powerful muscular attachment.</p>

<p>The outer lateral surface is of variable antero-posterior extent.</p>

<p>The distal articular surface is placed entirely toward the narrow
end of the bone, leaving at the proximal end a large smooth
rhomboid unarticular area, of which every side is a little concave:
it connects obliquely the proximal with the distal articular
surfaces. The distal articular area is divided by a diagonal ridge
into a long oblong area of which the inner and outer sides are sub-parallel
and the ends rounded: it is slightly concave in length
as well as transversely, and is slightly twisted like the flukes of
a screw. Adjacent to this region laterally is the other and sub-triangular
part of the articulation. The broad end of the triangle
is toward the broad end of the bone; it is concave in length
and flattened transversely. The two parts of the articulation
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">« 50 »</a></span>
are inclined to each other at a large angle, both looking downward
and outward, but on opposite sides of the bone.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">II. Distal Carpal.</span></p>

<p>The tablets of this bone comprise 22 specimens. Nos. 2, 3,
4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 15, 16, 19 and 22 are so mounted as to exhibit
the proximal surface. Nos. 7, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 20
and 21 show the distal surface of the bone. No. 17 is a cast
from the distal surface of a proximal carpal for comparison with
the proximal surface of the distal carpal. No. 16 is a cast from
the proximal end of the wing-metacarpal for comparison with the
distal surface of the distal carpal. No. 20 is a distal carpal of
unusual type, 19 is a cast from its proximal surface, and 21 is a
cast from the distal surface of the same specimen.</p>

<p>The proximal aspect of this bone is rather narrower than the
distal aspect; each is sub-triangular in outline, the sides being
convexly curved. In the long axis from the apex on the inside
to the short outer<a name="FNanchor_17" id="FNanchor_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[Q]</a> side the bone is convex proximally with an
oblique transverse depression; in the short axis, that is, between
the two longer sides, the middle of the bone is hollow, but the
oblique transverse depression makes both sides of the hollow convex,&mdash;so
that excepting the smooth unarticular triangular area adjacent
to the apex, the sub-quadrate articular surface is shaped somewhat
like two cones put side by side in such manner that the apex
of each touches the base of the other: the apex of that cone which
should touch the short side or base of the triangle formed by
the bone, is truncated by a depression which exhibits an oval
pneumatic foramen. Towards the apex, on the same side as the
pneumatic foramen, the margin of the bone is rounded for a
small terminal oval articulation which looks outward and upward.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_17" id="Footnote_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17"><span class="label">[Q]</span></a> Outer and inner are here used in accordance with the usual interpretation,
and the better to compare with birds.</p></div>

<p>The lateral aspects of the bone are at right angles to the
proximal and distal surfaces. They are smooth, a little concave
in antero-posterior extent, and convex in the opposite direction.
That one on to which the marginal articular surface impinges is
except for that surface sub-quadrate in outline; the opposite side
has a slightly crescentic form, the flattened outline being distal.
They show several small foramina.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">« 51 »</a></span></p>

<p>The distal aspect of the bone is comparatively flat. The distal
surface consists of a smooth unarticular part adjacent to the apex,
rather smaller than the corresponding area on the proximal aspect
of the bone. Between this part and the sub-crescentic articular
surface, which occupies the remainder of the distal area, is a large
circular pit, furthest removed from the side of the bone which
forms the sub-apical marginal articulation. The pit on the apical
side shows several small foramina; on the outer side of the bone
the roughened articular surface extends down the pit side. The
articulation is flattened from side to side of the bone. Its outer
margin is slightly prominent, and the margin of the pit is slightly
convex and prominent, so that the intervening articular surface in
the direction between these limits is concave. It is commonly
divided into two parts by a median band limiting a depressed half,
which is in a slightly different plane from the other half of the articulation.
Where the depressed part terminates towards the marginal
articulation, which does not extend so far distally, there is between
the two a small step-like roughened articular portion.</p>

<p>The large crescentic articulation described gave attachment to
the wing-metacarpal bone; if there was a second metacarpal
terminating in a claw, it must have been attached to the small
articulation last referred to. In No. 20 the pit is extremely small,
the impressed part of the articulation is small and deeply sunk,
while the apicular articulation is widened and shortened so as to
make the outline of the bone quadrate.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">III. Lateral Carpal.</span></p>

<p>The tablet exhibits eight examples of a bone which at its
distal end is attached to the marginal apicular articulation of the
distal carpal, thence extending proximally, and terminating in an
articular facet for the third bone of the fore-arm, so as to overlap
laterally both of the other carpals. The bone is compressed, is
three times as wide as thick, and in outline sub-quadrate with a
distal talon. On the inner side it is flat, and on the outer side
above the talon it is concave vertically and convex transversely
in such way that the side of the bone to which the distal articulation
is adjacent is thicker than the other side, and sometimes
bent at a sharp angle. The talon on the inner aspect of the bone is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">« 52 »</a></span>
flat and continuous with the quadrate side, but on the outer
aspect it is separated from the side by an elevated transverse thickening,
distally to which the bone is compressed, and rounded into
the adjacent parts. The talon extends over more than half of the
distal end of the bone, and constitutes with the remainder of the
distal end, the distal articulation, which is flat from front to back,
and concave from side to base. The proximal articulation is
cupped and extends over the whole proximal surface; it is at right
angles with the sides of the bone. Both the inner and outer sides
exhibit small pneumatic foramina. No. 8 differs from the other
specimens in its sub-triangular lateral outline, and general less
complex modifications.</p>

<p>The Carpus of the Cambridge Ornithosaurians at first sight
is not easily compared with that of Birds; Birds having but one
bone between the radius and the metacarpus. But that one bone
in the Ostrich, for instance, is not unlike in form to the proximal
carpal of Pterodactyle; while the proximal end of the metacarpus
presents so close an analogy with the distal carpal of the Pterodactyle,
that even were it not easily demonstrated that the bone in
Birds commonly called the metacarpus is a carpo-metacarpus<a name="FNanchor_18" id="FNanchor_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[R]</a>, it
would be strong evidence for such a determination. In Birds there
is a small lateral bone between the ulna and carpo-metacarpus
which is evidently homologous with the lateral carpal of our
Pterodactyles, and so, since this lateral carpal of the Ostrich is the
pisiform bone, it results that the lateral carpal of Pterodactyle is
the pisiform bone also. From this follows a conclusion of the first
importance in the interpretation of the hand. The fine hair-like
metacarpals of the Pterodactyle are on the side towards the pisiform
bone, while the great wing-metacarpal is on the side towards
the index finger.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_18" id="Footnote_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18"><span class="label">[R]</span></a> They separate without difficulty in the Chicken.</p></div>

<p>In Birds the rudimentary thumb (or second finger, according to
Owen) has no connection with the carpus. In the Penguin, <i>Aptenodytes
Patagonica</i>, it has disappeared altogether, and there then
remain two fingers of which the outer one (seen from the front
as we have placed our animal) is the larger, and has the greatest
number of phalanges, precisely as in Ornithosaurians. Moreover
the wing-metacarpal, in the Penguin especially, is seen to unite
with the carpus directly under the radius, as is the case with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">« 53 »</a></span>
Cambridge Ornithosaurians. Hence it follows that in Pterodactyles
the thumb is not developed, and that the wing-finger is not the
little finger, but the index finger, precisely as in Birds. If Goldfuss
gave a reverse arrangement it was because the hand in his
specimen, as is proved by the claws, was upside down. In the
immature state the distal carpal of Pterodactyle appears to have
been composite.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding the opinions of eminent German philosophers
to the contrary no reptile has a carpus comparable to that of the
Pterodactyle. If some of them have two rows of bones and a pisiform
bone, so have mammals, and the mammalian arrangement is
not more like the Ornithosauria than is that in Reptiles.</p>

METACARPAL BONE.<br />
<br />
<a href="#p_vi">Pl. 6.</a>
</div>

<p>The illustrations of this bone comprise 31 specimens. Nos. 1
to 15 are examples of the proximal end, and Nos. 16 to 31 show
the distal trochlear end of the bone. No. 1, which is nearly
entire, gives the form and proportions of the wing-metacarpal in
one species, but a knowledge of its variableness in German forms
would guard against an assumption that all the other Greensand
species were to be restored on the plan of this example. It is
3<sup>5</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inches long, to which three-eighths of an inch may be added for
the distal articulation, making the length up to 4 inches. The
proximal end is not well preserved, but in its wide measurement
is <sup>5</sup>/<sub>8</sub>ths of an inch; the distal end in the same measurement is
about <sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub>ths of an inch. A large example from the Chalk, in the
Museum of C. Moore Esq. of Bath, shows the bone more attenuated
distally. No. 1 is compressed so as to be oblong in
section at the proximal end, and ovate in the middle of the shaft,
which is slightly smaller than the distal end. One of the lateral
outlines is straight; the other is concave. The bone is straight.
In No. 30 the shaft where thickest measures less than <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> of an inch,
becoming nearly circular in section. The shaft of No. 31 measures
nearly an inch in width at its distal end, rather more than half an inch
in thickness. No. 10 is 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inch wide at the proximal end and <sup>7</sup>/<sub>8</sub>ths
of an inch thick. No. 9 would not have measured less when perfect
than 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inches over the proximal end, so that if it had the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">« 54 »</a></span>
proportions of No. 1 it would have measured when entire not less
than 16 inches in length.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Proximal End.</span></p>

<p>The proximal end has never been figured. Prof. Owen's
figure pl. <span class="smcap">IV.</span> fig, 4-5, First Supt. Cret. Rep. is probably part
of a jaw, and not the wing-metacarpal. The articular surface
is oblong with one corner rounded off so that the adjacent long
and short sides become confluent on the exterior surface of the
bone.</p>

<p>In the middle of the flat inside margin and extending proximally
is a semi-cylindrical process, which is prolonged a short
distance down the side of the bone as an elevated ridge. On the
flattened articular end this process is bordered by a semicircular
furrow which extends half-way across the bone, outside of which is
a slightly convex semicircular band which extends to the outer margin
of the bone, except towards the short side opposite to that one
which rounds into the outer side, where there appears to be a
narrow unarticular area. On the inside of the bone where the two
ends of the semicircular proximal furrow terminate are two deep
grooves which extend a short distance distally; they are both
limited by inward extensions of the short sides of the bone, that
crest being most developed in height and length which is toward
the flattened short side. The outline which these modifications
give to the inner side of the proximal surface is intermediate
in form between the letters S and <img src="images/m_rot.png" width="11" height="14" alt="" />.</p>


<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Distal End.</span></p>

<p>The distal end has been figured by Prof. Owen in the British
Fossil Mammals, p. 545; in Dixon's Geology of Sussex, Pl. <span class="smcap">XXIX.</span>
fig. 12; Cret. Reptiles, Pl. <span class="smcap">XXXII.</span> figs. 4 and 5, First Supt. Pl. <span class="smcap">IV</span>,
fig. 9-11, and other places, and fully described. It closely resembles
the distal end of a bird's tibia; and consists of a pulley-shaped
end set obliquely on to the compressed shaft, which just above
the junction is reniform in section, owing to the development
of <i>a median rounded ridge</i> on the same inner side of the bone
which bears the median ridge at the proximal end, while on
the opposite side there is a corresponding <i>median depression</i>
which does not extend far proximally. In this depression is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">« 55 »</a></span>
an oval pneumatic foramen; on the right of the median ridge
of the other side, but placed more distally, is another pneumatic
foramen. The median ridge has sometimes a slight furrow on
each side. It terminates proximally in strong muscular insertions,
which extend round the right side of the bone; and distally,
becoming more elevated and rounded, it curves obliquely to the
rights and forming one of the sides of the pulley, passes round the
base as three quarters of a spiral, the termination extending laterally
beyond the shaft. On this side of the bone, distal to the
median depression, arises another ridge strong and well rounded,
which is directed to the right, similarly passes round the base as
a spiral, and forms the other side of the pulley. It is not so prominent
as the border previously described. While the spirals
approximate at their origin, they become widely separated at the
base, making the articulation wider than the shaft. In No. 31
the three inches of the shaft which remain show both pairs of
its sides sub-parallel; the widest measures nearly an inch; the
base of the articulation is less than a quarter of an inch wider.</p>

<p>Limited to the base, between the two outer ridges of the pulley,
is a short median ridge slightly developed; so as to flatten the
middle of the concavity between the ridges, and divide it into two
grooves. The degree to which the middle ridge is developed varies
in different species. In No. 30, the smallest pterodactyle, remarkable
for a long wing-metacarpal bone, it is not to be detected. The
exterior sides of the trochlear articulation are broad, flattened,
and a little concave.</p>

<p>There is some variation in the way in which the shaft is set
on the trochlear end. It being often in the middle, but not
unfrequently inclined more to one side than to the other.</p>

<p>The metacarpus finds no close parallel among living animals.
The thread-like metacarpal bones suggest the condition of the hind-foot
in the Kangaroo. The predominant metacarpal suggests the
ruminants. But the nearest approximation is found among birds
where the bone for the middle finger is large and the bone for the
third finger is slender. This may be observed (among other examples)
in the Penguin and the Swan. But here the parallel ends.
The proximal end in Birds, we have already seen to be hidden by
the anchylosed distal row of the carpus, and the distal end though
often convex from side to side never presents the trochlear joint of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">« 56 »</a></span>
the Pterodactyle. Consequently so far as regards the form of the
articular ends the resemblance is closer with Reptiles and clawed
Mammals than with Birds. In Birds the small metacarpal is
usually of similar length with the large one as is the case with
Pterodactyles.</p>

FIRST PHALANGE.<br />
<br />
<a href="#p_vii">Pl. 7.</a>
</div>

<p>No perfect specimen of the first phalange has been found in the
Cambridge Greensand. Ten bones are mounted to illustrate it, all
of them less perfect than others in the series of associated bones.
No. 1 shows the heel of the proximal end; Nos. 9 and 10 are
portions of the proximal articulation from which the epiphysis
which forms the articular heel-part seen in No. 1 has come away.
Nos. 2 to 8 are the distal articular ends of first phalanges. It
is improbable that any of them belong to the second phalange,
since they agree in form, and show muscular attachments which
correspond.</p>

<p>Prof. Owen has figured the shaft of a fine example of this bone
in Dixon's Geology of Sussex, Pl. <span class="smcap">XXXIX.</span> fig. 11. A good proximal
end is shown in Pl. <span class="smcap">XXXII.</span> fig. 2, of Prof. Owen's monograph of the
Cretaceous Reptilia, but the figure appears to have been previously
given in Pl. <span class="smcap">XXIV.</span> fig. 2 of the same monograph. By far the
grandest specimens are drawn in Pl. <span class="smcap">XXX.</span> Prof. Owen names
these wing bones. In the "Literature of English Pterodactyles"
the loss of the proximal epiphysis from the specimen represented in
Prof Owen's fig. 1 and 2 led me to interpret the bone as an ulna.
Figs. 1 to 4 represent the proximal ends and greater portions of
the shafts of first phalanges. The lower bone in fig. 5 is neither
radius nor ulna, as stated in the text of the Cretaceous Reptilia,
but the shaft and distal end of a first phalange; the upper bone
being the second phalange.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">The Proximal End.</span></p>

<p>The straight shaft throughout its length is triangular in section.
One side of the bone is gently convex; this may be named for
convenience the outside. The two parts which make up the other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">« 57 »</a></span>
side are inclined, and have the angle in which they meet rounded;
one part looks upward and inward, the other downward and inward.
Towards the proximal end the bone widens and thickens,
and the moiety of the inner side which is away from the heel
becomes cleft, and has the sides of the depression rounded to form
a large pneumatic foramen. The articular surface looks upward
and a little outward on the side of the pneumatic foramen. It
consists of two semicircular concave grooves, separated by an intervening
low convexity. The outer of these grooves extends
from the margin of the extreme proximal point of the heel to the
widest point of the bone; the other groove more deeply concave,
is a third shorter, extending from inside the pneumatic foramen to
the heel. Here both grooves converge, terminating in a point,
exterior to which a little distally is a hemispherical mammilate
eminence. On the distal side of the eminence there is a depression
so as to make the angle behind the heel almost hemispherically
rounded. This articulation fits on to the distal articulation
of the wing-metacarpal.</p>

<p>When the proximal epiphysis forming the heel comes away, it
leaves a large sub-circular pit with a depressed narrow border.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Distal End.</span></p>

<p>On nearing the distal end, the angle of the inner side of the
shaft becomes more depressed; and the articulation becomes an
elongated oval, slightly convex transversely and convex in length
so as to extend distally in a curve in such way that the articulation
looks downward and outward from an aspect of the bone exactly
opposite to the aspect from which the proximal articulation looks
upward and inward. Hence the two articular surfaces are sub-parallel;
but the distal one at its distal termination is bent inward,
so as to make the adjacent lateral outline of the bone
concave on the inside at its termination. The articulation does
not cover the most proximal part of the distal surface.</p>

SECOND PHALANGE.<br />
<br />
<a href="#p_vii">Pl. 7.</a>
</div>

<p>On this tablet are mounted 14 specimens. Nos. 1 to 9 are
examples of the proximal end of the second phalange. If there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">« 58 »</a></span>
were more than two phalanges, of which there is no osteological
evidence, it is possible that proximal ends of succeeding phalanges
may be included with these. They all however resemble each,
other so closely as to lend no support to such a supposition. Nos.
?10 to ?14 have been mounted with the proximal ends because
they appear to be portions of the middle of the shaft of the
second phalange; they indicate a rapid distal attenuation, favouring
the idea of there being but two phalanges.</p>

<p>The proximal end of the shaft has the outer side flattened,
rarely concave, commonly slightly convex; the inner side being
much more inflated, and not dissimilar in form to the inner
side of the first phalange. Proximally the bone widens and one
lateral outline extends outward in a curve, on the inner side
of which, under the proximal articulation, is placed the pneumatic
foramen. The elongated oval articular surface is concave
from side to side and concave in length; it does not extend in
length so far as the straight side outline, exterior to it being a
crescentic flattened or convex area. The distal end attenuates
more rapidly in some specimens than others, and appears in Nos.
11, 12, and 14 eventually to become cylindrical; but none of the
specimens show its distal termination.</p>

<p>The phalanges of the wing-finger attain a grand development in
length which is not paralleled in Birds, nor surpassed in Bats. In
the Ostrich there are three phalanges in the wing-finger, while in
Ornithopterus there are two joints, and in other German Pterodactyles
four joints. The terminal joint in the Ostrich is a claw, but
in Pterodactyle the terminal joint appears to be unarmed as in ordinary
birds. The form of the bones in being compressed from side
to side is more bird-like than bat-like. But the claws in their
compression from side to side are more like the bat than the bird.</p>

shows a pit at the side and grooves above for ligaments; the
mesial pulley groove is shallow and broad. Seven specimens are
mounted in illustration, of which No. 3 may be regarded as
doubtful. It is possible that they may be metatarsals.</p>

OS INNOMINATUM.<br />
<br />
<a href="#p_viii">Pl. 8.</a>
</div>

<p>Nine specimens are mounted in illustration of the pelvic girdle:
Nos. 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 show the acetabular or femoral aspects.
The right os innominatum is exemplified by Nos. 1, 4 and 5;
the left by Nos. 3 and 6. No. 2 shows the sacral aspect of a
left ischium, and its attachments with the pubis and ilium. No. 8
is the sacral aspect of a left os pubis. No. 9 is the femoral aspect
of a right OS pubis. None of the specimens are sufficiently complete
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">« 60 »</a></span>
to give the form of any of the bones. The only known
example of an entire or nearly entire pelvis at all comparable in
form, is seen in the original specimen of Dimorphodon macronyx
figured by Buckland, <i>Trans. Geol. Soc.</i> Ser. 2. vol. <span class="smcap">III.</span> p. 217. In
nearly all the fossils from the Cambridge Greensand the bones of
the pelvis are anchylosed together.</p>

<p>The ossa innominata have been determined as right and left
on the supposition that the pelvis of the Dimorphodon is in
situ, and from the general correspondence of the form of the
constituent elements with elements of the pelvis in the lower
mammals, reptiles, and birds.</p>

<p>Each os innominatum shows a hemispherical acetabulum which
is slightly elongated in antero-posterior extent In the Dimorphodon
the bone which is superior to the cup, that is to say, which extends
dorsally along the sacral vertebræ is prolonged anteriorly as a
strong narrow straight style, the base of which is seen in the parts
marked <i>Ilium</i> in Nos. 1 and 6. A more perfect example may be
studied in a pelvis from the Cambridge Greensand preserved in
the collection of the Geological survey. Posterior to the acetabulum
a similar but stronger bony style extends for more than the length
of the acetabulum, curving slightly downward at its posterior part.
The dorsal outline of this portion of the bone is slightly concave.
The posterior horn like the anterior horn forms part of the ilium
which constitutes the upper half of the acetabular cup. The os innominatum
contracts in antero-posterior extent below the acetabulum,
and immediately widens again in a thin concave bony expansion.
The anterior or pubic outline is comparatively straight, and
at right angles with the ilium; the posterior or ischiac outline is
deeply cupped where the ischium unites with the ilium, and
becoming straight extends backward at a considerable angle.
The ischium contributes less to the pelvic cup than either the
ilium or pubis; it is flat in front and convex on the visceral side,
rounding into the narrow flattened posterior side. The pubis is
separated from the ischium by a suture extending vertically through
the obturator foramen. The obturator foramen [seen in No. 9] is
small and oval, less than half the diameter of the acetabulum, situated
below its ventral border. It passes obliquely downward and
a little forward, and its opening makes the exterior aspect of the
pubis concave; the visceral aspect of the pubis is convex from side to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">« 61 »</a></span>
side like the ischium. The sacral aspect of so much of the os
innominatum as is seen, is concave from the dorsal to the ventral
margins, and is cupped behind and below the acetabulum, the
surface being rough. Among reptiles the ilium is chiefly behind
the acetabulum, in mammals it is chiefly in front. In the over-lapping
group, Aves, it extends both ways. Among the Amphibia
the ilium is chiefly anterior to the acetabulum. In Crocodiles it
has a slight extension both ways, in Dinosaurs the extensions are
more marked and the whole arrangement approximates to birds.
But among animals which have been affiliated with reptiles the
Dicynodonts are the only order in which there is a pelvis so
mammalian and massive. If the ilium of the Monotreme genus
Echidna had a posterior extension, the pelvis would be altogether
comparable with the pelvis of this Pterodactyle, and would differ
chiefly in the larger obturator foramen, the perforated acetabulum
and the unanchylosed condition of the pelvic elements. The pelvis
of Apteryx does not make any near approximation.</p>

<p>Moreover specimens Nos. 3 and 4 show on the anterior pubic
border, about the base of the acetabulum, a slight pit or roughness
to which something has been attached, and in the original
specimen of Dimorphodon associated with the pelvis are two
triangular bones which recall something of the form of the
prepubic bones of Echidna. Most German Pterodactyles show
on the OS pubis an enormous prepubic bone. In Iguana the
pubis forms at its anterior border, a sharp angular process.
In Chelydra the process is long and narrower, and arises from
the middle of the border. In Echidna this prepubic process has
become a distinct prepubic bone and is more elongated. Unlike
the marsupial bones it is attached to the pubis by a wide base.
The anterior pubic roughness of Cambridge specimens, and the
loose bones of the Dimorphodon, &amp;c. indicate the existence of
structures in the Ornithosauria homologous with the prepubic
bones of the Ornithodelphia.</p>

<p>So far as it is comparable with living animals, the ilium is
altogether avian, differing in being narrower; and the pubis and
ischium are mammalian.</p>

<p>The upper anterior corner is the most elevated part of the
acetabular border, as in the great Auk and some birds of vertical
position of body, and many mammals.</p>

FEMUR.<br />
<br />
<a href="#p_viii">Pl. 8.</a>
</div>

<p>Twenty-six specimens are mounted to illustrate the Femur.
10 are proximal ends; 16 distal ends. But in the series illustrative
of species is an entire specimen of a right Femur 4 inches
long. Fragments Nos. 3 and 12 show proximal and distal ends
twice as large, but most of the examples are about the size of the
entire femur.</p>

<p>It is a straight sub-cylindrical bone, flattened in front, a little
compressed from front to back distally, and (in one type) compressed
proximally from side to side behind. The distal articulation
has a broad shallow channel passing down from the front and
imperfectly separating two condyloid parts, which extend a little
backward and are divided behind. The outer condyle extends a
little outward, and so gives the outer side of the bone at the
distal end an oblique compressed aspect like that which prevails
among birds and many mammals. Proximally the shaft contracts
suddenly and is produced upward, forward, and inward
as a rounded neck, as long as in the femur of any mammalian
carnivore, which expands rapidly at the end to form the hemispherical
ball, which articulates with the pelvic acetabulum.</p>

<p>No. 1 shows a well-marked pit for the ligamentum teres at
the back part of the ball. At the proximal end of the shaft
below the neck is a large pit for the obturator muscle, and at
the outer front angle a great trochanter. Proximally the bone
can only be compared with the mammalian Carnivora, Quadrumana
and Man; distally it is avian and mammalian.</p>

<p>In one genus exemplified by specimens 5-10 the obturator
pit is not developed.</p>

<p>Sometimes the shaft is curved a little convexly, outward and
forward.</p>

TIBIA.<br />

<p>Eleven specimens are mounted to illustrate the tibia, of which
1 to 9 are regarded as proximal ends; and 10, 11 with less confidence
are regarded as distal ends from which the distal epiphysis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">« 63 »</a></span>
has come away. It is to be anticipated that the distal end of
the tibia in Pterodactyle will when found approximate to the
distal end of the tibia in the bird.</p>

<p>The bone is at the proximal end straight and sub-cylindrical,
slowly enlarging proximally; convex behind, except for an elevated
boss some little way below the proximal articulation for
the attachment of powerful muscles. In front the shaft is a
little flattened proximally, with a mesial groove dividing two prominences
which are apparently homologous with the ridges below
the patella in birds. The proximal articular surface truncates the
shaft at right angles except at what is regarded as the outer front
aspect, where it rises into a small patelloid prominence.</p>

<p>It shows the impressions of two condyles, which correspond
in form with the distal end of the Femur.</p>

<p>Nos. 3 and 6 are regarded as left tibia; Nos. 4, 5, 7, 8, 9 as
examples of right tibia.</p>

<p>No specimen likely to be a fibula has been found. In Dimorphodon
and in German Genera the fibula is Avian in form. The
Crocodile offers some approximation to the Pterodactyle shape in
the proximal end of the Tibia, but the Pterodactyle has Avian
characters in addition. Its straightness and length, ridges on the
front and patelloid prominence, are Avian.</p>

TARSUS OR TARSO-METATARSUS.<br />
<br />
<a href="#p_viii">Pl. 8.</a>
</div>

<p>This fragment, which may be the distal end of the bone corresponding
to that called in birds the tarsus or tarso-metatarsus,
is badly preserved. Yet so close is its resemblance in form, structure,
and apposition of the constituent bones to what obtains
among birds, that it may probably be identified as the tarsus;
while the peculiar characteristics of Pterodactyle bones which it
shows, demonstrate that it is not from a bird, but from an Ornithosaurian
skeleton.</p>

<p>The bones are of paper thinness, and consist of a strong
bone behind which distally appears on the inner side to be compressed
and thrown backward and flattened at the side, exactly
like the inner toe in Natatorial birds. On the front of this
strong support, confluent with it, and confluent together, so that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">« 64 »</a></span>
the places of union are only seen at the distal end and in transverse
section, are three bones, together as wide as the bone on which
they rest. It does not appear possible that the distal articulations
could have supported more than three digits.</p>

<p>This bone, if correctly determined, offers points of affinity
with birds as pronounced and as important as any thing shown
by the extremities, for among reptiles a welding of the (tarsal or)
tarso-metatarsal bones is unknown, and here it is as absolute as
in any bird, and takes a characteristic bird shape. In the Rodent
Jerboa the metatarsus has much the same form as in a bird.</p>

<p>No phalanges have been recognised.</p>

ATLAS AND AXIS.<br />
<br />
<a href="#p_ix">Pl. 9.</a>
</div>

<p>Fifteen specimens are mounted to exemplify the structures
of the Pterodactyle atlas and axis. Nos. 1, 11, and 2 have
already been figured, and described by Prof Owen, the latter as
a section of a cervical vertebra.</p>

<p>The <i>atlas</i> centrum, a saucer-shaped disk of bone, commonly
united more or less intimately with the centrum of the axis, but
sometimes free. It presents in front a hemispherical cup for the
basi-occipital, and is flattened or slightly convex behind. Its
neural arch is seen in Nos. 2, 10, and 12; but the only specimen
with the arch entire is in the museum of James Carter, Esq.
The neurapophyses vary in form and size, but always are small
obliquely flattened lamellar bones, which extend upward and backward
to meet the neural arch of the axis, just above the neural
canal, where a thin and small cross piece connects them
together.</p>

<p>The distinctive aspect of these bones is given by the neural
arch of the <i>axis</i>, which is very much elevated, and is formed
by two flattened sides, which meet in a vertical ridge above the
neural canal, and look forward, outward and upward; extending
laterally more and more beyond the side of the centrum, but not
reaching so far back as the posterior articulation of the centrum.
Each side of the neural arch at its middle part behind is produced
into a thick obliquely flattened process, the under portion of which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">« 65 »</a></span>
shows the small posterior zygapophysial facets, which look downward,
outward and backward. The lateral outline of the part of
the neural arch above this process is concave; as is the lateral outline
between it and the centrum. Behind, the neural arch is concave,
and looks a little backward. The neural canal is stirrup-shaped in
front, but is higher and sub-ovate behind. The neural arch of
this, as of all the other vertebræ, except a few dorsals, is inseparably
united to the centrum, without a trace of the line of
union. In the middle of the side of the vertebra, and at what may
be presumed to be the union between the neural arch and the
centrum, in a concavity, is the pneumatic foramen. It is round or
oval, and varies in form and size though not in position. In No.
8 it exhibits the subdivided reticular structure characteristic of
the pneumatic foramina of birds. In No. 10, which has a short
centrum, the pneumatic cavities are reduced to a few small perforations,
no larger than would be made with fine needles.</p>

<p>The centrum is shorter than in cervical vertebræ, commonly
convex (No. 8) on the visceral surface; often with a slight longitudinal
hypapophysial ridge (Nos. 1; 7; 12) rarely flattened (No. 10).
Towards the hinder part the centrum widens, and becomes concave
on the visceral surface, sending off as do the other cervicals,
below the transversely elongated posterior articulation, a pair of
short strong apophyses.</p>

<p>The posterior articulation can only by a modification of the idea
be said to conform to the cup-and-ball plan, for though convex from
above downward and convex from side to side, the elongated
transverse measurement would be three times the depth. On
the under side an impressed transverse line divides the articulation
from the concave part of the centrum below.</p>

</div>

<p>Forty-three specimens are mounted to exemplify the variations
in size and characters of cervical vertebræ. These for the
most part are specific characters; and between the axis and the
first dorsal vertebra the variations in an individual were slight.
[Those nearest to the back, as in birds, are widest in front, and
have the highest neural arches.] The associated series show commonly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">« 66 »</a></span>
four cervical vertebræ behind the axis, and in two cases
apparently five; never more. So that as seven appears to be
the number of true cervical vertebræ in most if not all of the
German Pterodactyles, it may be presumed that the Cretaceous
Ornithosaurians also had this character in common, with Mammals,
and probably as persistent. In Iguana there are 6, in Monitor
7, and in Crocodile 8.</p>

<p>The centrum is united to the neural arch as in birds, without
a trace of suture; sometimes the neural arch is no wider than
the centrum, sometimes it extends over the centrum on each
side. Those forms with a narrow neural arch have the neural
spine high, and its sides look forward as well as outward. The
pneumatic foramen is oblique. An example is figured by Prof.
Owen, in the memoir on Pterodactylus simus, pl. 2, fig. 4. The
forms with a wide neural arch have the neural spine rising from
the middle of the dorsal surface, erect and equally compressed
from side to side. The pneumatic foramen is horizontal. An
example is figured in Prof. Owen's memoir on Pt. simus, pl. 2,
fig. 1. These two forms of cervical vertebræ may be regarded
as typifying two genera.</p>

<p>In both forms many characters occur in common, and as the
specimens illustrative of special modifications will be described
hereafter, the following description has been made to embrace
the chief characteristics of these vertebræ in Cretaceous Ornithosaurians.</p>

<p>The inferior aspect of the centrum is oblong (being narrower
than long), or quadrate; when quadrate the additional lateral
expansions are external to the pneumatic foramina, and are
formed by the neural arch and zygapophyses. The centrum
proper is a little wider in front than behind, and the side outlines
are concave. The base of the centrum is flattened, or more or
less hollow, or more or less tumid and regularly convex; in front
there is often a mesial ridge, which never reaches the posterior
articulation, and forms a prominent tubercle at the base of the
anterior articulation. At the posterior end the outline of the
centrum is concave, and mesially the bone has a hollow corresponding
to the tubercle in front of the adjacent vertebra;
and the part of the centrum on each side is prolonged slightly
into a strong rounded or flattened tubercle below the side borders
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">« 67 »</a></span>
of the posterior articulation; these posterior processes, in
vertebræ in situ, fitted, on each side of the mesial anterior process
of the vertebra behind, on to concavities more or less marked.
Analagous processes are developed in the cervical vertebræ of
many birds.</p>

<p>All the Cretaceous Pterodactyles have the articular surfaces
of the centrum transversely oblong, as have some birds. The
posterior articulation is convex from side to side, and convex from
above downward, and appears to extend a little further on this
neural than on the hæmal surface; in outline it is commonly an
elongated oval, but sometimes attends on the upper surface of the
inferior lateral tubercles. The anterior articulation is transversely
elongated, concave in both directions, and sub-triangular in outline;
that is to say, the superior outline is more or less convex, and
from its limits to the mesial tubercle at the base, the inferior
outlines are more or less concave.</p>

<p>The neural canal is sub-circular or ovate in outline, and quite
as large as the neural canal in vertebræ of Dinornis of similar
size.</p>

<p>The neural arch like the centrum has commonly a depressed
appearance. It always has a neural spinous process which is directed
upward. In the depressed type the neural surface of the vertebra
is in outline usually sub-quadrate, but concave at each side, and
concave in front and behind; the four corners are the processes
which support the zygapophysial facets, the surface is divided into
two lateral parts by the strong neural spine. These lateral
parts are from front to back flat, or slightly concave, or slightly
convex; and from the neural spine outward they are always
concave. The neural spine is commonly sharp in front and
flattened behind. The neural arch is placed well forward, so
that while a third of the neural canal remains uncovered by it
behind, rarely a sixth would be uncovered in front.</p>

<p>The anterior and posterior zygapophyses are commonly connected
by a more or less rounded ridge, undefined above, but
well defined below, since under its posterior part at about the
middle of the side of the centrum is placed the pneumatic
foramen.</p>

<p>The anterior zygapophysial processes are separated from the
anterior articular surface of the centrum by a more or less oblique
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">« 68 »</a></span>
channel. Towards the base of this channel in many vertebræ
may be seen a small and short flattened antero-posterior perforation
corresponding in position with the usually large perforation
for the vertebral artery. If the passages are to be regarded as
having subserved such a function, it will not be without interest
to remark the small relative size of the cerebellum in these
animals; since the vertebral artery conveys the blood to that
region of the brain.</p>

<p>The anterior zygapophyses are strong processes directed forward
and outward, compressed a little from side to side; they are
placed at the outer sides of the anterior articular face of the centrum,
and extend in front of it.</p>

<p>The zygapophysial facet is commonly oval and looks upward
and inward and forward.</p>

<p>The posterior zygapophyses are short and massive, but otherwise
correspond closely with the anterior zygapophyses, only with all
the parts reversed, and except that necessarily they are relatively
to the neural canal a little higher.</p>

<p>A sharp and well defined angular ridge, commencing at the back
of the zygapophysis, is directed inward, and forward, and upward
along the posterior margin of the neural arch to the top of the
neural spine. The posterior aspect of the neural arch is concave
from side to side, and makes a right angle with the superior lateral
aspect.</p>

<p>The part of the centrum exposed behind the neural arch is
convex above from side to side.</p>

<p>The pneumatic foramen between the centrum and the neural
arch varies greatly in size; it is oval and longitudinal.</p>

<p>The largest specimens have the centrum 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inches long; in the
smallest the centrum measures <sup>5</sup>/<sub>8</sub>ths of an inch in length.</p>

<p>In the second type of cervical vertebra the side of the centrum
makes a right angle with the base, and is separated from it by a
sharp angle as in struthious birds. The side of the centrum is concave,
with a few small pneumatic perforations; and the side of the
centrum, which is high posteriorly, rounds over the oblique ridge
connecting the zygapophyses, into the oblique lateral face of the
neural arch. The anterior zygapophyses are very large and the
posterior zygapophyses small and placed as high as the top of the
neural canal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">« 69 »</a></span></p>

<p>Every region of the vertebral column displays pneumatic foramina,
situated as in the vertebræ of birds.</p>

<p>The large proportional size of the neck-vertebræ is common to
some birds, and is conspicuous in many mammals, like the Llama. In
most mammals where the vertebræ have a cup-and-ball articulation,
the ball is in front, as it is in the dorsal vertebræ of the penguin, so
that those vertebræ are not comparable with Pterodactyles, although
on the under side of the centrum they similarly give off a mesial
process below the cup, and a lateral process below the ball on each
side. The neural spine in Pterodactyle is commonly more developed
than is the case with long-necked birds or mammals. Reptiles
such as Crocodiles and Lizards have the neural spines of the
neck-vertebræ well developed. Birds differ from Pterodactyles in
the peculiar articulation of their vertebræ. In both the centrum
is often depressed, in both it is concave from side to side in front,
and convex from side to side behind, but in birds it is also convex
from above downward in front, and concave from above downward
behind, while the reverse arrangement obtains in Pterodactyles. A
similar condition to that of the bird is seen in the neck-vertebræ
of the Kangaroo, of Man, and several mammals, only the vertical
curves are less marked. Vertebræ concave in front, and convex
behind, and devoid of cervical ribs, are met with among the Lizards,
but neither Monitor nor Iguana offer any parallel to the form of
the cervical vertebræ of Pterodactyle, which is best matched among
Marsupials and Birds. Birds commonly have more vertebræ in the
neck than have Pterodactyles, which in that respect resemble mammals
and some Lizards.</p>

<a href="#p_x">Pl. 10.</a>
</div>

<p>Twenty specimens are mounted to exemplify pectoral and
dorsal vertebræ. Like the cervical vertebræ, they include
two types of form, one with the centrum flat, figured in pl. 2. fig.
20-22 of the memoir on Pterodactylus Sedgwicki, and regarded
by Prof Owen as anterior dorsal; and the other form
with a convex centrum, figured 24-25 of the same plate of
the same memoir, regarded by Prof. Owen as posterior dorsal.
Following the analogy of birds such determination is as well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">« 70 »</a></span>
supported as the similar reference of the two types of cervical
vertebræ to anterior and posterior parts of the neck, but fuller
materials compel a reference of the two types of dorsal vertebræ
to two different genera.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Nos. 1, 3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 14, 15, 19 belong to the flat type.
Nos. 2, 4, 5, 11, 12, 16, 17, 18 exemplify the convex type.</p></div>

<p>Dorsal vertebræ are rare fossils; and in the associated sets
of bones never more than four dorsal vertebræ are found, rarely
more than one. No specimen of the type with a convex centrum
occurs in the associated sets.</p>

<p>The dorsal vertebræ with convex centra have all lost their
neural arches except No. 2. The form of the centrum is
half a cylinder, as long, or longer than wide, but sometimes
depressed, and wider behind than in front. The exterior surface
is smooth, convex from side to side, and slightly concave from
front to back. The neural surface is mesially excavated. Both
anterior and posterior articular surfaces are semicircular or
sub-ovate, being wide from side to side.</p>

<p>The anterior articulation is cupped, concave from the neural
to the hæmal surface, and concave from side to side. The posterior
articulation is convex from the neural to the hæmal surface,
in which direction, it usually shows striations, and from side to
side has a gentle convexity, sometimes so slight as to be nearly
flat.</p>

<p>The neural canal is large, ovate, and as high as is the centrum.</p>

<p>The neural arch is strong, compressed from back to front, and
placed as usual on the anterior part of the centrum. In outline
it is sub-rhomboid with the sides concave. There is a strong process
on each side above the neural canal for a rib, and apparently
a neural spine, but all are broken. The transverse processes for
the ribs are directed outward, and a little forward, flattened in
front and behind, the surfaces being sub-parallel, so that in front
the neural arch is concave from side to side. Behind, the neural
spine is directed between the transverse processes so as to over-hang
the exposed part of the superior surface of the centrum. At
the points where the neural spine bends back from the transverse
processes are the posterior zygapophyses, high above the neural
canal, and parted from each other by an interspace as wide as the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">« 71 »</a></span>
canal is high. They look downward, outward, and backward.
The lateral surface below the transverse process is narrow, flattened,
bends at a right angle with the posterior surface, rounds into
the anterior surface, is a continuous curve with the side of the
centrum, and is concave from below upward. The superior
surfaces of the neural arch have the sides sub-parallel, they are
each concave from side to side; and these surfaces are excavated
for pneumatic foramina.</p>

<p>Dorsal vertebræ of the type with the centrum flattened closely
resemble cervical vertebræ with the centrum flattened, differing
chiefly in the less length of the centrum. Occasionally (as in
No. 3) the neural arch comes away from the body of the vertebra.</p>

<p>The centrum is very depressed, sub-quadrate, and wider than
long; the base is flat, or slightly concave, with occasionally a slight
longitudinal mesial ridge; the lateral outlines are concave, so that
the bone is pinched in from side to side. The neural surface of
the centrum is flat and parallel with the base, and, as usual, wider
behind than in front, but the centrum is not there so high. The
surfaces for the neural arch are flat, and extend nearly to the
base of the centrum in front, so that they look upward, outward
and a little forward.</p>

<p>The articular ends are remarkable for their depressed oblong
character, still preserving the anterior concavity with a small
mesial process below, as in cervical vertebræ, and similar but
smaller processes at the inferior outer angles of the posterior
sub-semicylindrical convexity. The middle third of the anterior
cup is made by the trapezoidal anterior end of the centrum;
sometimes the sutures between it and the neural arch are well
marked.</p>

<p>The neural arch is large, commonly with a sub-circular neural
canal. The neural spine is high, compressed so as to have the
lateral surfaces sub-parallel and rounding into each other superiorly;
and it has a less antero-posterior extent than the centrum. At
its base behind it widens rapidly, and forms massive quadrate
processes, extending outward and backward, which on the outside
each have a flattened ovate zygapophysial facet, which also looks
downward. Above the facet and separated from it by a groove is
a tubercle. Between the zygapophyses behind the bone is concave
from side to side; the facets are placed above the neural canal.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">« 72 »</a></span></p>

<p>The posterior zygapophyses are placed considerably higher
than the anterior zygapophyses, and the part of the neural arch
between is rather constricted from front to back. The neural
arch steadily widens in front down to the base of the anterior
zygapophysial processes in such way that the more or less flattened
lateral surface looks outward and is gently concave from above
downward. A ridge commencing at the tubercle over the posterior
zygapophysial facet descends in a curve forward and downward,
to form the posterior border of the anterior zygapophysial
process. This is separated by a groove from the anterior articular
surface, and anterior part of the base of the centrum, and has the
aspect of a compressed part of the neural arch, extending obliquely
downward, and forward, over and beyond the articular surface of
the centrum. The anterior zygapophysial facets are oblong,
narrow from side to side, and long from front to back; they are
directed forward and a little outward, and are flattened, make
nearly a right angle behind with the front of the neural arch,
and look upward and inward. They are sometimes placed as high
as the top of the neural canal, but are commonly lower. Around
the neural canal the bone is conically impressed.</p>

<p>Minute pneumatic foramina are in the usual position, between
the centrum and the neural arch; and sometimes others behind
the anterior zygapophysial process.</p>

<p>The largest specimen known has the centrum nearly an inch
and a half long.</p>

<p>The dorsal vertebræ in Cambridge specimens would appear to
make a nearer approximation in number to birds than to Mammals
or Lizards or Crocodiles, though Chelonians have few vertebræ in
the back. Among Reptiles the form of the vertebra makes some
approach to that of the Monitor, Chameleon and Scink. In most
Mammals the dorsal vertebræ have the centrum convex, though in
the lumbar region its visceral surface often becomes flattened. But
though very unlike there is a nearer resemblance to the lower
dorsal vertebræ of a Struthious bird.</p>

<a href="#p_x">Pl. 10.</a></div>

<p>Seven specimens are mounted to exemplify the ordinary
structures of the Ornithosaurian sacrum.</p>

<p>Nos. 1 and 2 have the centrum convex, exactly as in the dorsal
vertebræ of the convex type. Nos. 3-7 have the centrum flattened,
following in general features the plan of the dorsal vertebræ
with flat centra.</p>

<p>No. 1 is a vertebra from a sacrum, where perfect anchylosis
had not been induced; it has the neural arch well preserved, and
shows the sharp suture which united it to the preceding vertebra.</p>

<p>No. 2 shows two entire vertebræ and part of a third, which
have lost the neural arches but have the centra perfectly anchylosed
together. The middle vertebra measures <sup>5</sup>/<sub>8</sub> of an inch in
length, and at the suture from side to side measures more. The
surface is smooth, regularly convex from side to side, and gently
concave from back to front. The last vertebra shows the articular
vertebral surface; it is convex in both directions, and oblique,
so that a large part looks upward. The anterior of the three
vertebræ is pinched in at the lower part of the sides of the
centrum. No. 1 shows that the neural surface of the centrum
is deeply excavated, making the neural canal an elongated upright
oval. Above the centrum, which forms only the middle third
of the articular surface, the neural arch expands on each side
into a wedge-shaped transverse process, the lower surfaces are
flattened, and continuous with the centrum, while the upper
surfaces are flat and horizontal as in birds and Dinosaurs, and
form the platform from which arises the massive neural spine.</p>

<p>In front the transverse wedge is flattened and compressed,
so as to look forward and outward, and in the middle shows a
large ovate pneumatic foramen. Behind, the wedge is compressed
so as to look backward and downward.</p>

<p>The neural spine is massive and forms rather more than half
the height of the vertebra. It is flattened with a ridge rising
near its base in front and ascending in a concave curve obliquely
backward and upward. The anterior parts approximate a little
in front, while the small parts posterior to the ridge approximate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">« 74 »</a></span>
a little behind. The sides of the neural spine approximate
superiorly, and appear to round into each other.</p>

<p>There is a notch on each side in front at the base of the
neural spine, and another above the central articulation. The
neural spines appear to have been united by suture. It may be
instructive to compare the neural spine just described with
the specimens <b>J</b>. <i>c</i>. 10.</p>

<p>Of the second type or genus No. 4 to 7 all show the anterior
cup for the last lumbar vertebra. No. 3, 5 and 6 all show two
entire vertebræ and part of a third preserved, but no specimen
shows the posterior termination of the sacrum. No. 7 has the
articular face of the centrum very broad, and greatly depressed. In
No. 6 it is ovate and has the neural arch preserved; above a semicircular
neural canal it sends out on each side a short horn-like
zygapophysial process. No. 4 is remarkable for the small
size of the circular neural canal, the centrum when entire
measuring an inch from side to side, while the neural canal
only measures <sup>5</sup>/<sub>16</sub> of an inch. No. 5 is figured by Prof. Owen.
No. 4-6 appear to have given off transverse processes from
the sides of the centra. No. 7 appears to widen into transverse
processes at the point of suture between the centra.</p>

<p>In No. 3 the base of the sacrum is flattened, and its sides
pinched in, and concave in outline from back to front. In
this hollow are small pneumatic foramina, and between the
hollows the vertebræ widen in the line of the suture so as
to send out strong short transverse processes or tubercles.
Above the hollows are given out the strong horizontal quadrate
pyramidal transverse processes. All their sides are flattened
or a little concave, and the under side displays a large ovate
pneumatic foramen. Each of the four angles of the transverse
process gives off a ridge. The lower ones descend obliquely
to the anterior and posterior intersutural tubercles. The upper
two ascend obliquely, in front and behind, and form rounded
ridges on the neural spine. The neural spine is flattened,
moderately compressed from side to side, and cupped a little
over each transverse process. In front the neural spine is
flattened transversely and perpendicular; the transverse processes
are also flattened and a little in advance of the neural spine.</p>

<p>The sacrum in its general aspect is Mammalian. In the Bird
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">« 75 »</a></span>
the vertebræ are much more numerous and do not retain their individuality
so well. In Reptiles properly so called, the sacrum
never includes more than two or three vertebræ, and those commonly
remain unanchylosed. But in almost any placental Mammal
in which several vertebræ are anchylosed together, a sacrum
similar to that of the Pterodactyle is met with. No mammalian
sacrum, however, is furnished with pneumatic foramina.</p>

<p>Thirteen specimens are mounted to exemplify the osteology of
caudal vertebræ. No. 7 has been figured by Prof. Owen in the
memoir on Pterodactylus simus, pl. 2 fig. 13-16. The centrum
of the largest specimens measures one inch and a quarter
long, and the vertebra is half an inch wide from side to side
in the middle. The smallest specimen No. 13 has the centrum
<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> of an inch long. The vertebræ vary in proportions, some
being much more slender than others. They present a close
approximation in form to the first type of cervical vertebræ,
differing chiefly in being more elongated.</p>

<p>They are elongated bones constricted in the middle, so that
the outlines of the sides seen from above or below are gently
concave; the outline of the anterior end is sub-rhomboid, the
outline of the posterior end is sub-pentagonal, as would be
a transverse section of the vertebra. The long outlines of the base
of the centrum and of the top of the neural arch are sub-parallel.</p>

<p>The two sides of the upper surface of the neural arch are
smooth, flattened, a little concave from back to front; they are
inclined to each other pent-house wise at about a right angle,
and are separated throughout their length by a narrow slightly
elevated neural spine. Behind, the neural arch is truncated
transversely so as to expose the posterior neural surface of the
centrum, which is convex from side to side. The outermost
lateral angles of the neural arch are the posterior zygapophysial
processes, short and strong above the centrum, with a tubercle
on the upper surface, and showing the sub-circular zygapophysial
facets behind; they look backward and downward, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">« 76 »</a></span>
are separated by a groove from the region of the centrum. Under
the sharp ridge which connects these zygapophyses behind, the
neural arch is excavated, and the cup shows the termination
of three canals. The largest one is the upright oval of the
neural canal in the middle, on each of its sides separated by
a narrow bony wall is another perforation, very variable in
size and shape, sometimes b&amp; large as the neural canal, but
usually small and circular. The anterior end of the neural
arch is cut into, so that as seen from above, the straight sharp
anterior margins diverge mesially from each other at a right
angle, and so expose to view a small anterior part of the neural
surface of the centrum. These lines are prolonged forward
and outward, to form the upper margin of the anterior zygapophyses,
which are compressed and prolonged over and beyond
the sides of the anterior articulation, from which they are separated
by a slight groove; the anterior and posterior zygapophyses are
connected by a rounded ridge. The anterior end of the neural
arch is excavated, but less so than the posterior end; in the
middle is the oval perforation of the neural canal, and at the
sides other perforations corresponding to those behind are
placed a little in advance of the neural canal. The anterior
and posterior articular surfaces differ in no respect from those
of cervical vertebræ.</p>

<p>The inferior surface of the centrum is separated from the
sides by two ridges parallel to the lateral concave outlines of
the neural arch; they extend from sides of the front, more
or less well marked, to the tubercular processes at the base
of the sides of the centrum behind. The dice-box shaped area
of the centrum so inscribed is usually concave from front to
back, and concave from side to side behind, and convex from
side to side in the middle; this convexity is only broken in
front by the development of the slight mesial hypapophysial
ridge.</p>

<p>The sides are narrow, flattened, look downward and outward,
are a little concave from front to back, round into the centrum
and into the neural arch, and show at about the middle a
small pneumatic foramen, which is variable in size, but largest
in No. 8, and sometimes a mere puncture.</p>

<p>The caudal vertebræ differ in many ways from other animals.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">« 77 »</a></span>
They have neither transverse processes, neural spines, hypapophyses
or hæmapophyses. In the persistence of the neural arch down the
tail they resemble reptiles and birds rather than mammals, in which
nothing but the centrum persists to the end of the tail. The vertebræ
are furnished with vertebral arteries which run through the
neural arch parallel to the neural canal, in exactly the same position
as do the vertebral arteries in the neck-vertebræ of the Llama.</p>

<p class="center">Pl. <a href="#p_xi">11</a>, <a href="#p_xii">12</a>.</p>

<p>The skull of Dimorphodon differs in form and in many important
details of structure from that of Rhamphorhynchus; and
both of these types of skull are strikingly unlike that of the short-tailed
animals named Pterodactyle. Hence, as it will be shown
that the Cretaceous fossils of this class belong to very distinct new
genera, there is no reason for assigning to them by anticipation
any class of cranial structures. The cranium of this type of animal
has never been critically described, and for all that is yet known
to the contrary Pterodactyles may differ between themselves as
much as birds or mammals. Their affinities have been unknown.
Therefore, before describing bones it may be desirable to state the
grounds on which the several specimens are referred to the Ornithosauria.
The fossils on which this section of the memoir is
founded are, the basi-occipital and basi-temporal bones, the anterior
portion of a cranium, the back parts of four crania, facial
bones, and the quadrate and quadrato-jugal.</p>

<p>The crania are all no larger than that of the Heron; though
from the Greensand are bones and jaws indicating Pterodactyles
both smaller and larger. The skulls are mostly remarkable for
wanting both basi-occipital and basi-temporal bones. And the
specimen of basi-temporal and basi-occipital corresponds posteriorly
with the Pterodactyle atlas, anteriorly with these crania; it
is hence concluded to have belonged to a similar animal. Being
relatively twice as large, it indicates that in these animals the
basi-occipital condyle was proportionally larger than in known
birds; and that animals of a cognate kind had skulls probably
twice the size of these. The anterior basal part of the hinder
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">« 78 »</a></span>
sphenoid terminates in a remarkable triangular surface, with two
perforations, which are separated by a median ridge. Almost
entirely corresponding with this is the basal surface of the anterior
part of a cranium, fractured in front of the pituitary fossa.
Therefore, and as it indicates a similar capacity of brain, it is
regarded as belonging to the same kind of animal as the others ;
but being five times the size, it must, if the proportions of the
Heron were preserved, have been part of a head a yard long.</p>

<p>Now, as there is no other animal with the same texture of
bone, or exhibiting with high organization the same diversity of
size, these cranial fragments are referred to the jaws and bones of
Pterodactyle. So marked are their structures that many quarry-men
refer vertebrate fossils to their several orders with almost as
much accuracy as would a practised anatomist.</p>

</div>

<p class="center">Basi-occipital, Owen, <i>Sup. Cret. Rep.</i> p. 6, T. 1, figs. 11, 12, 13.</p>

<p>This bone was not found associated with any set of fossils that
would induce us to refer it to one species more than to another.
Its Ornithosaurian character was probable; and Prof. Owen described
it in his last memoir on the Greensand Pterodactyles.</p>

<p>But though indubitably basi-occipital, it is so anomalous in
some respects that the Professor regarded the under as the upper
surface; since then the investing phosphate of lime has been
removed, and the bone is now described in what appears to be
its natural position.</p>

<p>Viewed from above the fossil divides into two parts; the
occipital condyle, and an anterior, wide, transversely oblong extension
terminating at each side in a strong short horn. The
posterior half of the condyle shows large cancelli as though so
much of it had been covered by the articular cartilage. The
sides of the condyle converge, so that posteriorly it is only two-thirds
of the width it has at the foramen magnum, which would
appear to indicate a comparatively slight lateral motion of the
head. The condyle is hemispherical posteriorly and superiorly;
there is a depression between it and the great foramen of the
skull; inferiorly it is flat.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">« 79 »</a></span></p>

<p>It is <sup>7</sup>/<sub>16</sub> of an inch long; posteriorly <sup>9</sup>/<sub>16</sub> wide, nearly <sup>6</sup>/<sub>16</sub> of
an inch high anteriorly. It terminates in front superiorly in
an elevated transverse ridge.</p>

<p>On removing the matrix, the anterior surface of this occipital
bone was found to be concave; yet as nothing but cancellous
structure is seen it may be but imperfectly ossified or more probably,
imperfectly preserved. And the bottom of this cup expands
forward in a thin sheet of bone a quarter of an inch long
and half an inch wide, which on the under side is continuous
with the base of the condyle.</p>

<p>On each side of this floor and partly extending in front of
it, and below it, is an irregular piece of bone, half an inch
long, resembling anterior zygapophyses of cervical vertebræ.</p>

<p>Though in most vertebrates the basi-occipital enters into the
basal floor of the skull, the median bones are either so placed
that they rest one upon another from before backwards or abut
against one another nearly perpendicular, so that the basi-sphenoid
comes commonly to underlap and partly hide the basi-occipital.
Nowhere among Amphibia or Reptilia do I know
of the reverse position occurring. In some fishes there is an
approach to it. Thus a slight anterior bony expansion of the
basi-occipital in the Cod fits partly into a horizontal slit in the
basi-sphenoid[A]. In the Carp the basi-occipital has a spathulate
basal expansion like that of Pterodactyle, but it is underlapped
by the basi-sphenoid<a name="FNanchor_19" id="FNanchor_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[S]</a>. In some mammals the under side of the
basi-occipital extends further forward than does the neural side,
as for example in the Sheep and Goat; while in a few others, as
in the Walrus, the reverse positions obtain.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_19" id="Footnote_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19"><span class="label">[S]</span></a> Parasphenoid of Prof. Huxley.</p></div>

<p>But it is among Birds that the structure described in Pterodactyle
is evident and characteristic. For although the bony
plate under the sphenoid,&mdash;Mr Parker's basi-temporals,&mdash;is mostly
anchylosed to the bones about it, and less with the occipital
than with others, its position and relations are quite the same
as those of the expanded flap of this Pterodactyle basi-occipital.
Therefore it is identified with the basi-temporal bones.</p>

<span class="smcap">Back of the Cranium.</span><br />
<br />
<a href="#p_xi">Pl. 11.</a>
</div>

<p>This fossil is an inch high, rather wider, and half an inch
long. It well shows the bones at the back of the skull, the
basi-cranial bones, and the bones posterior to the frontals, which
roof in the Cranium. There are in it striking resemblances to
the back of the skull of some Natatores, as the Grannet and
Cormorant, and of some Grallatores as the Heron, and Gallinaceous
birds as the Cock.</p>

<p><i>The base of the skull.</i> The bones here indicated are the basi-occipital,
basi-temporal, and basi-sphenoid. The former two have
come away as from an articular joint, and are wanting. The
basi-occipital does not enter into the floor of the cranial cavity,
and only rims the foramen magnum. But its basi-temporal expansion
rests beneath the posterior part of the basi-sphenoid forming
the base of the skull; its long convex anterior end fits into the
concave groove at the back of the anterior part of the sphenoid.
The squamous basi-temporal bone appears in this species to have
been as long as the foramen magnum is wide, and to have been
relatively thicker than in the other form already described.</p>

<p>The <i>basi-sphenoid</i> is a thin expanded bone forming the floor
for the cerebellum, and terminating anteriorly in a triangular
mass, while the slightly convex part behind, covered with the
basi-temporals, is nearly square. It enters into the foramen magnum,
forming its lower part; and is confluent with the ex-occipitals
behind, with the periotic, alisphenoid and perhaps with the
squamosal at the side; and as in birds all these sutures are obliterated.
This is probably the only instance in the Animal Kingdom
in which the basi-sphenoid takes so important and singular a
share in the functions of the basi-occipital bone. The anterior
part of the basi-sphenoid projects below the posterior part, is
nearly flat on the basal surface, and forms an equilateral triangle
with the apex in front and base behind. In the middle of the
triangular bone is a slight longitudinal ridge, and behind the
middle of each outer side a rather large foramen which appears
to be the inferior opening for the carotid artery. The triangular
part is hollow and as long as the quadrate portion. The lateral
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">« 81 »</a></span>
parts of this anterior bone are nearly flat. They converge upwards
and are rounded in front to form the boundary of the
pituitary fossa, and do not appear to have terminated in a spine.
Above are the alisphenoids.</p>

<p><i>The upper part of the skull</i> is divided into two segments by
a strong straight transverse ridge, which leaves the occipital
bones behind, and the parietal &amp;c. in front.</p>

<p>The occipital bones anchylosed together are about two-thirds
the width of the foramen magnum, and of the parietal bones, with
which latter the supra-occipital makes an angle of 45°. The
surface is irregular, and especially is marked by a deep concavity
just above each ex-occipital. The supra-occipital projects slightly
over the plane of the foramen magnum, to which the strong ridge
bounding the segment in front is parallel. The great foramen
is nearly round, being slightly compressed at the upper part of
the sides: it measures <sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub> of an inch high and is nearly as wide.</p>

<p>The <i>occipital bones</i> make with those at the base of the skull
an angle of about 145° or 150°. In outline they are a transverse
diamond shape. The mastoid portion is not to be distinguished
from the other bones, but appear to terminate the sides of the
strong occipital crest, which by posterior compression of the
squamosals and parietals, becomes very strong, and makes the
backward boundary of the temporal foss. This crest is in the
same plane with the anterior border of the basi-temporals.</p>

<p>The <i>parietals</i> meet above in a slight ridge. They are two
rectangular bones twice as wide as long, forming a semicircular
roof for the brain, which looks outward and a little backward.
Anteriorly these bones unite with the frontals in a slightly
flexuous transverse line; and inferiorly they are connected with
the periotic, the squamosal, and perhaps with the anterior
point of the alisphenoid: they do not descend to the plane of
the articulations of the free quadrate bones. The surface is
smooth, and on the upper part flat, but concave below from side
to side.</p>

<p>Below these parietals are the <i>squamosals</i> and <i>alisphenoids</i>,
but the suture between them is not seen. They are in form
a trapezium where the short side is anterior, and the lower
third is folded inward so as to be confluent with the anterior
part of the sphenoid. The fold forms a ridge, which I suppose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">« 82 »</a></span>
may run obliquely over the alisphenoid. The unfolded squamosal
part is a flat and smooth oblong, with parallel sides, the bones
are in parallel planes and nearly perpendicular to the base of
the skull. Where the alisphenoid joins the sphenoid, there is
a considerable concavity, above which is a small circular impression.
These strips approximate inferiorly, so that the width
of the skull there is rather more than half what it is at their
outer margins. They shut off the pituitary body in front of
them, and appear to form part of the wall for the orbit of
the eye.&mdash;The slightly convex, lateral, squamosal parts above the
fold continue the circular transverse outline of which the parietals
are the upper half. They extend anterior to the parietals, and
on the inside give attachment to the frontals. Like the parietals,
they make a sharp bend outward at their hinder border, and
form the lateral terminations of the occipital ridge, which is the
widest part of this fossil.</p>

<p>The only portion of the specimen now to be described is the
large region at each side looking downward, which extends from
the occipital ridge to the sphenoid. It is an irregular pentangular
hollow with many cavities, the hinder of which are for the ear.
Two cavities above these, under the widest part of the skull,
appear to be a double articulation for the quadrate bone. The
outer transverse one with the squamosal is separated by a deep
groove from the inner and more vertical one, which may therefore
be regarded as with the petrosal bone. These excavations form
the posterior half of the pentagon. The anterior half is a smooth
rhombus not separable from the basi-sphenoid.</p>

<p>Such is the external appearance of the occipital and parietal
segments of the skull of a Cambridge Pterodactyle. Each segment
forms a large ring of thin bone, inclosing part of a brain-cavity as
large as that of a bird and shaped like that of a bird; and which
moreover is made up of the same bones as the cranium of a bird;
and these are in almost exactly the same proportions as those of
the Common Cock.</p>

<p>My own investigations do not substantiate Wagner's discovery,
that the back part of the skull resembles that of the Monitor.
Iguana would have offered a slightly nearer comparison, but they
both differ from Cambridge specimens of Pterodactyles in characters
like these.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">« 83 »</a></span></p>

<p>In the lizard,</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The cranial bones do not enclose the brain.</p>

<p>There is no division of the back of the skull into an occipital
segment and a parietal segment by a girdling crest.</p>

<p>The squamosal bone does not enter into the cranial wall.</p>

<p>The quadrate bone does not articulate with the wall of the
brain-case.</p>
</div>

<p>While the peculiar backward development of wings of the parietal
in a diverging V form, give the Lizard skull an aspect of its own.</p>

<p>So that it must be asserted that the differences of these Pterodactyles
from Lizards are so wide as to preclude comparison.</p>

<p>With the Crocodile, in which the cranial bones are massive, and
the quadrate bone firmly packed in the skull, comparison would be
no less difficult.</p>

<p>The Delphinidæ, in both the form of the jaws and of the back
of the head, give some support to Wagler's fancy, in putting the
Pterodactyle into his curious creation, the Gryphi<a name="FNanchor_20" id="FNanchor_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[T]</a>. But in
the porpoises the parietal bones form as narrow a band as they
do in the Duck; and are quite unlike the bones here described.
In the Dolphin the two condyles almost unite into one semicircular
condyle (in young specimens), owing to the enormous development
of the ex-occipitals, which almost if not entirely exclude the basi-occipital
from the foramen magnum. The dolphin moreover has
no quadrate bone. But notwithstanding the absence of a division
into occipital and parietal segments, the form and arrangement of
the bones in the skull of the porpoises approximate more to the
Cambridge Pterodactyles than is the case with Lizards.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_20" id="Footnote_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20"><span class="label">[T]</span></a> The Gryphi are a class of animals intermediate between Birds and Mammals
according to Wagler, and including Pterodactyles, Ichthyosaurus, Plesiosaurs,
Ornithorhynchus, and Myrmecophaga.</p></div>

<p>But with Birds the correspondence is so close that it would be
difficult to discover differences. That one of the condition of the
occipital bone seems to be the most important; another is, that
from the relatively smaller size of the cerebellum the parietal bones
appear to cover a larger part of the cerebrum; and a third is the
strong triangular condition of the sphenoid in front of the sella tursica.
With these exceptions there is nothing to distinguish the
fossil described from the cranium of a bird.</p>

</div>

<p>Another cranium has occurred which must be referred to a different
genus. Its preservation is less perfect, but it similarly exhibits
the occipital and parietal segments of the skull. All the
bones are blended together without a trace of a suture.</p>

<p>The <i>occipital region</i> is flat. Its outline is not defined owing to
the extent to which the sharp crest, in which it terminated outwardly,
has been broken away. The occipital condyle is broken off.
The foramen magnum is of an ovate form&mdash;flattened at the base.
The ex-occipitals at its sides are impressed as though from contact
with the neurapophyses of the atlas. Mesially, over the foramen
magnum is a vertical elevated crest (now rubbed away), which may
have given attachment to a bone like that post-superoccipital crest
described by Quenstedt in the <i>Pterodactylus suevicus</i>. The occipital
region makes a great angle with the flat basi-temporal region,
as in birds.</p>

<p>The <i>parietal region</i> is convex from below upward, the lateral
parts converging towards the crown, which however presents a
broken and worn surface. From side to side the squamosal
and parietal bones are concave, owing to the extended occipital
crest behind, and the rapid widening of the skull in front
caused by the large size of the brain.</p>

<p>In <i>front</i> is seen a section of the brain-cavity. It is very
like in form to the two halves of a pear put together side by
side with the stalk downward. I have removed some of the
phosphate of lime from the brain-cavity, and although it has
not been excavated to the cerebellum, the great depth of the
brain is well seen, and the convex character of the cerebral
lobes, between which a crest of bone descends mesially as in
the ethmo-sphenoid mass next described. At each of the
lower outer angles of the brain, extending into the cancellous
brain-walls to the outermost film, is an ovoid convexity, covered
with a thin film of bone. They entirely correspond with the
optic lobes, being in exactly the same position as in birds, only
relatively rather small. Underneath the optic lobe on the outside
is a small concavity, apparently the articulation for the quadrate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">« 85 »</a></span>
bone. The basi-sphenoid mass below the brain is of considerable
height, the upper half flat and smooth, the lower half fractured
and cancellous.</p>

<p>In the main this skull is like the other one, differing chiefly in
the depth of the sphenoid, in the mesial ridge between the cerebral
lobes, in showing the optic lobes, and in having anchylosed basi-temporal
bones. There would hence appear to have been considerable
variations in the skulls of Pterodactyles even in the Cambridge
Greensand.</p>

<p>The symmetrical bone which I have so named is a wedge-like
mass tapering in front, keeled above; flattened below, and cupped
behind on each side. It belonged to a very much larger animal
than the last fossil, and probably to a very different genus.</p>

<p>The <i>inferior surface</i> is triangular, an inch and an eighth wide
behind, at the base, and an inch and a quarter long; but it is
broken at both ends. In its longitudinal median line is a strong
keel stopping short in front, dying away behind, and forming
with the compressed margins a considerable hollow on each
side, at the back part of which is a large oval foramen. This
surface, though five times the size, corresponds in form, ridges,
and foramina with the anterior part of the sphenoid described
in the article on the back of the cranium.</p>

<p>The <i>posterior surface</i> is at right angles to the inferior one,
but its lower third shows only fractured phosphate of lime
filling perhaps the anterior part of the pituitary fossa. Its
upper part also is broken. But on each side is a large concavity
measuring in the fractured fossil an inch and a quarter high,
three quarters of an inch wide, and half an inch deep from the
unbroken median ridge where the cups become confluent at their
base. The whole specimen is two and a quarter inches high.
From the determination of the under side it follows that these
smooth hollows, over each of which an impressed mesial line descends
obliquely outward, are a part of the anterior boundary of the brain.</p>

<p>From the middle of the outer convex border of the oval
remains of these cups for the cerebral hemispheres, a strong
blunt ridge descends obliquely down the sides of the bone to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">« 86 »</a></span>
terminate the compressed anterior end of the bone just in front
of the hypapophysial ridge of the sphenoid. Above this ridge
the bone is much compressed anteriorly, forming a strong straight
mesial keel above, which rapidly approximates to the base; the
height of the bone in front being one inch and a half, which is
also its extreme length.</p>

<p>The region below the oblique ridge is a concavity, but it is a
little compressed from side to side behind, and has the same anterior
compression, so that the elongated oval of the fracture at
the anterior end of the bone is only three-eighths of an inch wide.</p>

<p>The superior ridge will probably have supported the frontals,
and the anterior end would terminate in the orbito-sphenoid.</p>

<p>The lateral ridges appear to correspond with what Prof.
Huxley has described in the Ostrich as the ridge indicative of
a supra-presphenoid ossification pointed out by Kölliker. The
groove which is here noticed on the cerebral surface may indicate
the same division. If so, the upper and anterior part of the
mass would be the ethmoid.</p>

<p>This mass offers a considerable resemblance to the frontal portion
of the skull of a dolphin (<i>e. g.</i> Delphinus delphis) from which
the maxillary, premaxillary, palatine and nasal bones have been
removed. But in the Porpoise the mesial ridge dividing the cerebral
hemispheres is not prolonged so far forward as in the Pterodactyle;
the cranial bones are often as smooth on the inside. Notwithstanding
Wagner's assurance that the Pterodactyle skull is very
like a Monitor's, he would have looked in vain for an ossification
in Monitor, Iguana, or other Lizards, comparable with this mass.
And although the brain is closed in front by bones in Serpents,
it is by the frontal bones, which form a covering for nearly
the whole of the conical cerebrum. Nor in the Crocodile is
there any ossified mass in front of the brain, although the
brain approximates nearer to Birds than is the case with other
living Reptiles. Among Birds such a structure as that of the
Pterodactyle is characteristic, but no bird has it so massive and
mammal-like, though an approximation is made in some thick-skulled
birds like <i>Ciconia marabou</i>. And in birds it usually
is prolonged much further forward than appears to have been
the case with Pterodactyle, where from the rapid tapering of
the mass in front it appears to have ended in a vertical ridge
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">« 87 »</a></span>
like that in Parrots and Birds with a moveable beak. In
Birds there is usually a median ridge dividing the cerebral
hemispheres, but there is also often a small olfactory lobe prolonged
in front of the cerebrum, to which nothing analogous is
indicated in these fossils.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_21" id="Footnote_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21"><span class="label">[U]</span></a> For the opportunity of making this description, I am indebted to the
kindness of John Francis Walker, Esq., M.A., F.G.S., F.C.S., &amp;c., who some
time since forwarded to me the whole of his rarer Ornithosaurian remains for
description in the Geological Magazine,</p></div>

<p>The original specimen is in the collection of J. F. Walker, Esq.,
of Sidney Sussex College. When found it only displayed the
front of the cerebral hemispheres, and Mr. Walker generously
gave me permission to remove the investing cancellous bone and
phosphate of lime, and thus exhibit the form of the cerebrum
and its relations to the cerebellum. The lower part of the
brain is not preserved. But adherent to the sides of the fossil
are still left parts of the temporal bones, and part of the bone
at the back of the orbit which closes in the brain. The form
of the cerebellum is not quite perfect behind, but it must have been
unusually small.</p>

<p>The cerebral lobes taken together are much wider from side to
side than from back to front, and have a transverse elliptical
outline, except for the mesial notch behind for the cerebellum.
The lobes are a little flattened above, and divided from each
other by a deep mesial groove, which makes each lobe convex
from side to side. They are well rounded at the front and at
the sides, and are a little compressed towards each other below
in the region of the orbits. Behind they become covered superiorly
as in birds with a greatly thickened part of the squamosal
and parietal bones. The surface of the cerebrum is smooth. There
is no indication of a pineal gland. The cerebellum is small, like
a pea between two filberts. It is sub-hemisphercal, is placed
close against the cerebrum, and appears to give off narrow lateral
parts, like those seen in many birds, only that they abut against
the back of the cerebral lobes as in the Hare and some Mammals.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">« 88 »</a></span>
In no reptile is there a brain in which the cerebrum embraces the
front of the cerebellum, or in which it attains to such an enormous
size. F&#339;tal Mammals (<i>e. g.</i> the horse and the sheep), even when they
have attained to a considerable bulk, and many adult mammals,
still have the optic lobes dividing the cerebrum from the cerebellum
as in Reptiles.</p>

<p>The only Mammal which shows any near approximation to this
brain is the <i>Ornithorhynchus</i>, in which the cerebellum is very small,
but the cerebrum is not so well rounded in front. The form approximates
to the brain in Man. But with Birds the resemblance
is so close&mdash;with the owl and the goose&mdash;that there is no character
to distinguish the brain of the fossil animal from those of the
recent ones. A section of the cerebrum in this specimen entirely
corresponds with a section of the brain-cavity in the second skull
described, as does the backward extension of the cerebrum with
the extent of the cerebral cavity, and the narrow cerebellum with
the narrow channel parallel to the walls of the foramen magnum,
as in <i>Gallus domesticus</i> and Birds. The front of the brain corresponds
with the cast of the front of the cerebral lobes taken
from the Ethmo-sphenoid mass. Thus the specimens agree among
themselves, and prove the Pterodactyle to have had a brain indistinguishable
from that of a Bird. And when it is remembered
how distinctive this kind of brain is, and that it approximates
rather towards the higher Mammals than towards Reptiles, the
fact attains unusual importance in determining the Pterodactyle's
place in nature.</p>

<a href="#p_iv">Pl. 4, fig. 6, 7, 8.</a>
</div>

<p>In 1859 Prof. Owen described with doubt as the Frontal
of Pterodactyle, a symmetrical bone. A smaller but more perfect
specimen has since been obtained for the Woodwardian
Museum; and a fragment of intermediate size is in the rich
collection of the Rev. T. G. Bonney. From the descriptions
already given it is impossible for it to be the frontal. There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">« 89 »</a></span>
is no proof that it is a skull bone. If of Pterodactyle the
compressed lateral spaces could only be part of the nasal passages,
or the impressions of a palatine or pterygoid articulation.
And as the external surface of every specimen is keeled, and
as the palatal surface of the upper jaw of every known Greensand
Pterodactyle is keeled, and as the concavities slightly converge
to the keel, it might be a bone from the under side of the
head,&mdash;the vomer.</p>

<p>The smallest specimen is a compressed sub-semicircular bone
1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inch long, <sup>9</sup>/<sub>16</sub> inch high, and a <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inch thick. The under surfaces
converge to form a strong keel, which is flattened off behind.
Above this, the posterior third of the bone is compressed
obliquely to half the thickness, as though a bone had over-lapped
this area on each side. If the oval spaces are nares, that
bone might have been the pterygoid or palatine. Three-fifths
of the remainder of the bone are taken up by the smooth oval
depressions, which might be the inner walls of the nares; and above
this is a margin of bone widening into the triangular compressed
part in front, which, if the fossil is rightly determined, must have
fitted into the posterior end of the maxillary or anterior end of
the palatine bones.</p>

<p>A specimen collected by the Rev. T. G. Bonney is preserved on
the sacral side of a left <i>os innominatum</i> with the keel downward.
It appears to show a sutural surface from which an anterior part
has come away. And if this specimen is compared with the
neural arch of the sacral vertebra <b>J</b>.<i>c</i>.4.1, it will be found to
correspond entirely. It is not impossible that <i>c</i>.10.1, 2 may be
vomerine, and <i>c</i>.10.3 sacral, but there are no distinctive characters
between the specimens to warrant such a determination.</p>

QUADRATUM.<br />

<a href="#p_xi">Pl. 11.</a><br />
<br />
<span class="smcap">and Quadrato-Jugal.</span>
</div>


<p>In the Woodwardian Museum are two distal ends of the
quadrate bone and two other fragments showing the quadrato-jugal
with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">« 90 »</a></span></p>

<p><i>Quadrate.</i> The smallest specimen is <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> an inch over the
articular surface for the lower jaw and a quarter of an inch
thick. It is concave from side to side in front where it shows a
large pneumatic foramen near the basal end; it is bent from the
articulation a little backward. It is convex behind; and between
the foramen and the articulation sends inward and forward a great
wing like that of the quadratum in birds. The specimens are broken
short off and do not show any articulation above, where the
bone contracts.</p>

<p>The distal articulation is double, like two long cones placed
together; that in front having the base outward, while the
hinder one has the base on the inner side. The largest specimen,
which is much broken, shows the articulation half an inch thick.</p>

<p><i>Quadrato-jugal.</i> This is a thin flat squamous bone, apparently
of a transverse diamond shape, which is anchylosed to the anterior
lateral margin of the quadrate, at right angles to the articulation.
The lower margin is straight, as is the upper anterior margin,
which appears to have received the malar bone above.</p>

<p>The upper posterior side is broken, but shows a large foramen
near to the side of the quadrate. The base of the diamond is
at the articulation, and at its apex is a small fragment of smooth
surface, either part of a foramen, or the orbit of the eye.</p>

<p>In this specimen the articulation, which is broken, is about <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub>
of an inch wide, <sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub> of an inch thick. The remaining piece of the
quadrate is an inch long. The quadrato-jugal is an inch and <sup>3</sup>/<sub>16</sub>
high, and between its broken ends 1<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inch long. It is thick and
strong where joining the quadrate, but the rest of the bone is about
an <sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub>th of an inch thick.</p>

<p>The quadrate bone is Avian in possessing a pneumatic foramen,
and Avian in the form of so much of the distal end as is preserved,
and in the articulation for the lower jaw. The process which
it sends inward on the inside is probably for the pterygoid bone,
after the manner of Birds. Before anchylosis with the quadrato-jugal
bone set in, as may be seen in <b>J</b>.<i>c</i>.11.4, the union was made
by a hemispherical knob on the outside of the quadrate, as in <i>Gallus
domesticus</i>. The squamose quadrato-jugal is a distinctive character.</p>

<p>This determination is conjectural. Its form is such as would
make it probable that it is part of the head. A more perfect
specimen is seen in <b>J</b>.<i>c</i>.1.2.7.</p>

<p>The best specimen is a compressed sub-quadrate fragment of
bone terminating at one end in a long reniform articular surface,
and at the other end in a fracture where the bone is rapidly
thickening. A side, regarded as the outer one, is flattened, being
slightly concave in length, and slightly convex from side to side.
The form of the inner side of the bone is determined by the
inward curve of the thick part of the articular surface, which
sends a rounded ridge obliquely on to the side, so that while it is
concave from side to side at the articulation, at the fracture it
is convex from side to side. All the specimens are large, the
articulation being not less than an inch long.</p>

OS ARTICULARE AND PROXIMAL<br />
END OF LOWER JAW.<br />
<br />
<a href="#p_xii">Pl. 12.</a>
</div>

<p>Prof. Owen has described in a 'Palæontographical' monograph
the proximal end of a mandible in which the sutures are obliterated.
But there is one specimen of a young right ramus showing
the inner and under part of the mandible to be the surangular
bone which unites with the angular or outer bone by a longitudinal
and vertical suture traversing on the inner side the great
upper groove; and on the surangular the greater part of the
articular bone rests. The articulation is strong and double, consisting
of a deep transverse hollow, bounded by a strong over-locking
ridge in front and a slight ridge behind; and this area
is divided into two tapering furrows by a strong oblique and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">« 92 »</a></span>
rounded crest, which passes from behind inward and forward.
Just behind the articulation is a ?pneumatic aperture, and then
the upper surface tapers to the under surface, forming a heel,
of which one specimen measuring an inch deep on the inside
of the articulation has <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> of an inch still left and is more than <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>
inch thick at the fracture. In a specimen belonging to the
Rev. T. G. Bonney the outside of the jaw is <sup>11</sup>/<sub>16</sub> of an inch deep,
and under the articulation <sup>5</sup>/<sub>16</sub> of an inch deep. The articular
area is <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> of an inch wide and <sup>6</sup>/<sub>16</sub> of an inch long.</p>

<p>Seven specimens indicate four species.</p>

<p>The proximal end of the lower jaw is entirely Avian. The
pneumatic aperture, as in birds, is placed behind the articulation,
which is shaped as in many birds. Commonly in Ornithosaurians
the bones are anchylosed and all trace of sutures obliterated, as in
most birds. In the Goose, however, the six elements of each side
are sometimes as readily separated as in reptiles. And in some
Pterodactyles the bones separate.</p>

THE TEETH.<br />
<br />
<a href="#p_xii">Pl. 12.</a>
</div>

<p>The first three teeth are usually larger than those which are
placed behind them, in this respect rather resembling some fossil
reptiles than Dolphins, and presenting a character like that seen
in the Dimorphodon. They are placed in oblique oval sockets.
They have a single fang like Cetaceans, Edentates, Reptiles, and
like the premaxillary teeth of Mammals. Cambridge specimens
of jaws are not sufficiently perfect to show whether the teeth are
limited to the premaxillary bone; but this appears to be the case
in <i>Pterodactylus crassirostris</i> (Goldf.), and probably in <i>Ornithocheirus
compressirostris</i> (Owen), [<i>Palæontographical Society</i>, 1851,
Pl. 27], and is so regarded by Professor Owen in his later writings.
Yet the significance of this fact seems to have been forgotten, and
Cuvier's dictum about their teeth still has influence. He says,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">« 93 »</a></span>
"The teeth, by which the examination of an animal ought always
to be commenced, here present nothing equivocal. They are all
simple, conical, and nearly alike, as in the crocodiles, monitors,
and other lizards." But, on the one hand, the Dolphins demonstrate
that a mammal might have similar teeth even in the maxillary
bone; and, on the other hand, since teeth in the premaxillary
bone always are single-fanged, and commonly have a simple sub-conical
crown, there is absolutely no evidence in the teeth of the
affinities of the animal, which, so far as this portion of its economy
went, might as well have been a fish or a mammal as anything
else. In the succession there is nothing very distinctive. In the
Crocodile one tooth comes up under another, as is commonly the
case with mammals; and in mammals the fangs of the old teeth
are often partially absorbed so that the teeth drop out into the
mouth. In the Pterodactyle the new teeth came up on the inner
side, as in the Ichthyosauria&mdash;a tribe of animals as singular in
their affinities as the Ornithosauria. Occasionally specimens show
a small furrow on the inner side of the fang, indicating absorption,
but there is nothing to show how many times the teeth were
renewed: in the Dolphins there is but one set, and in Crocodiles
the teeth are replaced many times. In form and size the teeth
are very variable. They are directed obliquely forward, and are
curved backward and inward. They taper in an elongate cone,
compressed from side to side, flattened on the outside, moderately
convex on the inside; rarely the sides meet in a ridge after the plan
of Pliosaurus, Megalosaurus, Dakosaurus, &amp;c.; more frequently the
lateral margins round into each other. Usually the enamel is quite
smooth, sometimes, as in No. 1, it is finely striated and wrinkled.
Some teeth are nearly circular and some quite straight. The
ovate fang contracts below, conically, and is closed, leaving a long
hollow pulp-cavity in its interior. Nos. 9, 10 show the marks of
the successional teeth on their inner sides. No. 11 appears to have
had the crown slightly worn at the tip during the animal's lifetime.
In transverse section of the crown the tooth structure resembles
Ichthyosaurus, Cetaceans, and Bats. The dentine is filled
with calciferous tubes which radiate as in Ichthyosaurus, and towards
the centre of the tooth are seen in transverse section to
present many angles, almost like radiated corpuscles. They are
separated by interspaces of their own width, and run towards the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">« 94 »</a></span>
circumference, sometimes straight and sometimes wavy, parallel to
each other. They send off branches usually at right angles
which anastomose with the adjoining tubes. The dentine is in
concentric layers, and shows layers of sub-circular cells as in the
teeth of Mammals. The enamel is a thin transparent layer with
fewer and finer tubes than the dentine.</p>



<hr class="chap" />

<h2><a name="A_SUMMING_UP" id="A_SUMMING_UP">A SUMMING UP.</a></h2>


<p>The story of the structure of the Ornithosaurians of the Cambridge
Greensand has now been told, and it only remains to gather
up the threads of their affinities and determine the Pterodactyle's
place in nature. But before doing so, so various in importance
are the characters enumerated, that I would first offer a few remarks
on the classificational value of characters among the Reptilia,
with which Pterodactyles have been most commonly grouped.</p>

<p>The naturalist who only examines organisms now living on the
earth, symbolizes to himself, by the term Reptile, a definite sum
of characters, with definite subdivisions and subordinate grouping,
to which the extinct types of life extricated from the rocks cannot
entirely be adapted. When the fragmentary, and often isolated
or ill-associated, bones of fossilized animals are contrasted with
corresponding bones in the skeletons of Serpents, Crocodiles, Lizards
and Turtles, not infrequently it is found that the characters attributed
to different Ordinal groups are interlaced in a single
individual with a type of organization peculiar to itself, and important
as are the modifications of existing orders. These characters
occasionally are grouped with others which in living animals had
been deemed characteristic of Fishes, Amphibia, Birds, and Mammals.</p>

<p>The Reptilia of the Palæontologist is therefore a vast and
provisional group, ever acquiring new characters, to which no
diagnosis can be applied. And although certain empirical characters
have served to allocate the specimens in their several orders,
in general with sufficient accuracy, yet from the imperfect preservation
of some of the remains, or the imperfect extent to which
their structures are known, and the want of recognised canons by
which to measure their relative values, it has not been possible to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">« 95 »</a></span>
discuss the relations of the several orders to each other or with
the larger groups on which some of them impinge.</p>

<p>Classifications represent more or less faithfully the gradational
increase in the sum of the characters of an organism, as well as the
increase in importance that those character severally attain. Thus
gathering, so far as may be, from the chaos of individuals, <i>a common
plan of structures</i> on which the genus, order, or class is
moulded from a less specialized group of organs. The fundamental
structures of a vertebrate animal, so far as their persistent importance
can be measured, are, those connected with</p>

<table summary="list">
<tr>
  <td class="tdr">I.</td>
  <td class="tdl">Perpetuating the race.</td>

<tr>
  <td class="tdr">II.</td>
  <td class="tdl">Construction of the brain.</td>

<tr>
  <td class="tdr">IV.</td>
  <td class="tdl">Locomotion, i.e. skeleton, muscles, &amp;c.</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>And these characteristics are for the most part so interlinked,
that it becomes difficult to assign to one order of animals a relative
superiority over another order; since when a single set of organs
is prominently developed in one group it often happens that
another set of organs has a like pre-eminence in an allied group.
Thus among reptiles it might be considered that</p>

<div style="width: 15em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: left;">
<i>Crocodiles</i> have the best hearts, and<br />
<i>Turtles</i> the best lungs.
</div>

<p>And since these structures in their functions severally modify and
determine the use of other structures, the meaning that terms like
Crocodilian and Chelonian really have is that they represent the
aspect of Reptilian organization when seen through the specialization
of respiration, or circulation of the blood. The soft parts
thus determining the nutrition and function of the muscles and
skeleton, anatomists in examining the bones of extinct animals are
accustomed to reverse the order of their inferences, and infer from
modifications of the skeleton what had been the characters of the
soft and more vital structures.</p>

<p>On the presumed accuracy of this method of research rest
many results of Comparative Anatomy. But since the shapes of
bones are determined by the muscles as well as by inheritance, it
is always to be remembered that a similar form of bone may obtain
in different orders or classes of animals, as the result of a similar
function in a special region of the body. Such resemblances are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">« 96 »</a></span>
familiar to anatomists. Hence much caution is required from the
Palæontologist to distinguish between the characteristics of a group,
and the extent to which they may be modified by function. This
distinction is the first principle of classification. But it is always
difficult to estimate the importance of characters in fragments of
bones or parts of skeletons, and the difficulty is increased by the
fact that if what appears to be but a functional modification should
pervade all the species, it becomes a characteristic of the group,
and its power of modifying the other organs in a peculiar way has
to be considered.</p>

<p>Thus for all practical purposes birds may be said to be characterized
by wings, which almost acquire the dignity of class characters
from their influence on the respiratory function. But in some
birds it has been thought that no bone of the fore-limb was ever
developed<a name="FNanchor_22" id="FNanchor_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[V]</a>; and the difference between such a phenomenon and the
wing of a Swift, for example, is one almost of infinity, as compared
with any other aspect that the anterior limb might have assumed.
Therefore, since a bird may part with its fore-limbs and yet remain
a bird, I infer that it might apply its fore-limbs to the ground, become
a quadruped, and be a bird still. And if in this process the
other structures remained unchanged, no one would regard the
modification as more than an ordinal one. But should the vertebræ
change also, or the pelvis, or the covering of the integument, or
the jaws become toothed, then, although the heart and lungs and
brain of the imaginary animal retained their class characters, the
functional differences being more than those of an order would
constitute it a sub-class.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_22" id="Footnote_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22"><span class="label">[V]</span></a> According to Prof. Owen, in Dinornis.</p></div>

<p>In the same way it is conceivable that serpents may have
existed with well-developed limbs, and if they retained their
other characters the limbed forms would constitute a sub-order
of serpents; but if to these characters they added a closed palate
united to the cranium, they would constitute a new order of reptiles.
A chelonian might be entirely deprived of its bony covering,
and it would still be a chelonian, differing only as a separate
family. So that structures which to the eye appear fundamental
may be lost without affecting an animal's systematic position, just
as animals while resembling each other in form may possess dissimilar
organization.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">« 97 »</a></span></p>

<p>Even with the living or typical Reptilia, naturalists are divided
as to the number of ordinal groups into which they naturally fall.
It is however generally agreed that the Amphibia or Dipnoa of
Fitzinger, have no near affinity with the true reptiles. Milne-Edwards,
Van der Hoeven and Agassiz make the remainder into
three orders, as did Cuvier:</p>

<div style="width: 7em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: left;">
  Chelonia,<br />
  Sauria,<br />
  Ophidia.<br />
</div>

<p>Stannius, Gray, Owen and Huxley, on the other hand, by dividing
the Saurians make four orders, to which Dr Günther by his description
of Sphenodon has given evidence of a fifth:</p>

<div style="width: 7em; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: left;">
  Crocodilia,<br />
  Chelonia,<br />
  Sauria,<br />
  Ophidia,<br />
  (Rhynchocephalia.)
</div>

<p>De Blainville in a remarkable classification (1816), made three
orders, Chelonians, Emydosaurians [crocodiles], and Saurophidians;
the latter group being subdivided into Saurians and
Ophidians.</p>

<p>In his "Handbuch der Anatomie der Wirbelthiere" Stannius
unites the Crocodilia and Chelonia into a group called Monimostylica;
while of the Sauria and Ophidia he makes another group
called Streptostylica. Similar groups were made by Dr Gray, and
named Cataphracta and Squamata. They are identical with the
"cuirassed" and "scaly" reptiles of Dumeril and Bibron.</p>

<p>The <i>Astylica</i> (Sphenodon) have no penis.</p>

<p>The <i>Streptostylica</i> have a double penis, lungs simplified at the
distal end into a mere air-bladder, brains with a moderately
elongated cerebrum, the palate mesially open, scales, leathery shell
to the egg cut through by a tooth on the premaxillary bone.</p>

<p>The <i>Monimostylica</i> have a single penis, lungs well subdivided,
ventricle of heart partly [turtles] or entirely divided [crocodiles],
brains having the cerebrum broad or high, a closed palate, scutes,
a calcareous shell to the egg.</p>

<p>Thus the chief differences between Turtles and Crocodiles on
the one hand, and Lizards and Serpents on the other hand, are
not so much in the fundamental vital structures, though these
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">« 98 »</a></span>
undergo changes even in the families, as in the different ways in
which the muscles and skeleton are modified. The typical lizards
diverge widely from the crocodiles, and in those osteological features
which admit of comparison they make at least as near an
approach to the Chelonians. But leaving the limbs and pectoral
and pelvic girdles out of consideration, lizards find their natural
place side by side with the serpents.</p>

<p>Attempts have been made by Palæontologists to incorporate
the new ordinal groups which they have been compelled to create
for some fossils, along with the true Reptilia; but such a proceeding
destroys the value of the term Reptile as a measure of a known
organization. In the absence of knowledge of the brains of Dinosaurs,
Ichthyosaurs, and Dicynodonts, their union with the Reptilia
can only have a stagnating effect on Palæontology, for there is
no proof that they are Reptiles in the same sense as are Crocodiles
or Chameleons: while their bones being used as standards of
Reptilian structure in comparisons, they adjudicate the place
in nature of other animals by an authority which has never been
established.</p>

<p>Before any inference can be drawn from the forms of bones
in extinct animals, their relations to vital structures and to way
of life must be known in animals which still live. This may give
some clue both to their functional significance and to the extent
to which they are inherited and not directly attributable to
function. But an idea of the morphological value of the bones
of living animals is only gained by comparing them with the
remains of their extinct allies, tracing the now imitative structure
back to its origin in a function which has ceased to be displayed.</p>

<p>Professor Owen in his "Comparative Anatomy of the Vertebrates"
(1866) admits nine orders of Reptiles, five of which are
extinct, some of the extinct orders being supposed to rank lower,
while others are higher than the living types. They are arranged
in this way,</p>

<p>In what characters the Ichthyosaurs are lower than living
reptiles I have been unable to discover. The palate may be better
compared with a struthious bird than with a reptile; and the
pectoral girdle may be better compared with the Ornithodelphia
than with a reptile, while all the trunk-vertebræ have ribs such
as are associated in living animals with a four-celled heart. But if
it is a lower animal type than living reptilia, the student will ask,
how much lower? does it descend to the Dipnoa, and prove to be
the missing link between the Amphibia and Reptilia? and wherein
is the evidence? Or does it not with Dicynodonts and Dinosaurs
rather form an outlying class uniting the reptiles with the mammals.</p>

<p>In the same way, when Pterosauria and Dinosauria are placed
above living reptiles, we are compelled to ask how much are they
above, or what are the characters which bind them to the Reptilia
at all? No satisfactory evidence has ever been adduced to show
that the Dinosauria are Reptiles. And of the claim of the Pterodactyles
to such a position, the facts detailed and now summarised
will be the best evidence.</p>

<p>The highest structure shown in these remains is the brain-case.
The cavity for the brain is in every respect like that in
the skull of a bird. It resembles brains of a high type in having
the cerebral lobes convex in front; since, in the lower mammals,
there is a resemblance to reptiles in the conical form of the
cerebrum; while the brains even of some of the placental
mammals are not well distinguished from those of reptiles. Although
the brain of the Ornithorhynchus is entirely mammalian,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">« 100 »</a></span>
it is more like the brain of a reptile than is the brain of the
Pterodactyle. No evidence of affinities could be adduced which
would outweigh this. Taken by itself it would lead us to anticipate
for the Pterodactyle those vital structures which birds
have in common.</p>

<p>Next in importance to the brain are the pneumatic perforations
in the bones. They are seen in the lower jaw, the quadrate bone,
in the whole of the vertebral column, in all the bones of the fore-limb,
excepting one or two fragments, in the scapula and coracoid,
in the os innominatum, in the femur and in the tibia. In
such of the bones as can be compared, the pneumatic perforation
is usually situated in Birds as it is in Pterodactyles. In Birds
the bones are filled with air through these perforations, and as a
principle the greater the motion of the animal, the greater is
the number of bones filled with air. This air is received from
the air-sacs which receive it from the lungs, and return it through
the lungs again. There is thus in birds a sort of supplemental
lung-system, which circulates air through the body. Nothing of
the kind exists in any other class of animals. The respiratory
system in birds is more perfect and complex than in the other
vertebrata, and, as a result, the temperature of the blood on the
whole is hotter.</p>

<p>In Pterodactyles the reticulate character of the perforations
proves that they were pneumatic, and supplied the bones with
air. The fact that the bones were supplied with air, necessitates
an elaborate system of air-sacs to furnish the supply. And the
existence of these air-sacs speaks incontestably to bronchial tubes
opening on the surface of the lungs to supply them, and to the
existence of lungs essentially like those of birds. The outward
and backward direction of the coracoid bones may indicate that
the lungs were larger than in a bird.</p>

<p>The circulation of air through the bird's body has relation to
rapid motion through the atmosphere, which necessarily produces
more rapid respiration than would comparative quiescence. The
same inference must be applied to the Pterodactyles. But rapid
respiration only means more rapid oxidation of the blood, and
conversion of the purple cruorine into scarlet cruorine,&mdash;that
is, the conversion of venous blood into arterial blood. And if
venous blood is converted into arterial blood by a lung-apparatus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">« 101 »</a></span>
like that of a bird, and with a rapidity like that in a bird, there
must be a circulation of the blood as rapid as in birds. Such a
circulation is only maintained by a heart with two auricles and
two ventricles. Therefore Pterodactyles had the heart like that
of birds and mammals.</p>

<p>Now, since the temperature of the blood is chiefly dependent
on respiration and circulation, and Pterodactyles had respiratory
and circulatory organs which in living animals produce hot blood,
it results that they were hot-blooded animals.</p>

<p>Thus the heart and lungs are exactly such as would have been
inferred from the brain, and, like it, they are avian. And so
important are these vital structures all taken together, that the
inference from them upon an animal's affinities would overbear all
other evidence that could be adduced except reproduction; for
they demonstrate the plan on which an animal was built, and are
the motor power which enabled it to use its skeleton in a way
that stamped upon it a peculiar form.</p>

<p>In the head such structures as are preserved conform with
slight variations to the avian plan. Other Ornithosaurians show
in the parts which are not preserved in Cambridge specimens
some characters which are not avian; they are in part as much
mammalian as reptilian, and in a few points entirely reptilian.
But it might be misleading to take German specimens into consideration
in forming an estimate of the Pterodactyles of the Cambridge
Greensand, which were probably a different ordinal group,
and may have had material differences in structure.</p>

<p>The vertebral column as a whole is distinctive.</p>

<p>The neck and sacrum are mammalian, and the tail reptilian.
The proc&#339;lous vertebræ are characteristic of reptiles, but in some
animals, as Chelonians, they vary in different regions of the body;
and among amphibians the character is inconstant in genera
nearly allied.</p>

<p>The hind-limb is in part mammalian and in part avian; if
there be any reptilian characters in the foot, they are not less
mammalian.</p>

<p>The os innominatum is avian and mammalian.</p>

<p>The pectoral girdle is avian.</p>

<p>The fore-limb is avian and mammalian.</p>

<p>The wing-finger is distinctive, though formed on the avian plan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">« 102 »</a></span></p>

<p>Thus, if with an avian basis some parts of the skeleton present
points of agreement with reptiles, in other points there are resemblances
with mammals not less characteristic. These phænomena
do not show that in so far the animal is a mammal or a reptile,
but only that mammals, ornithosaurians, and reptiles have had a
common origin, and that while they have been differentiated so
as to form separate classes they have severally retained characters
which formerly were united in one class. It is a skeleton intermediate
between reptiles and mammals, and well distinguished by
mammalian, reptilian, and peculiar characters, from birds. It therefore
forms a parallel group with birds, displaying the ornithic
organization in a differently modified skeleton. Yet it differs more
from existing birds than they differ among themselves, for the discrepancies
are in points of structure in which all existing birds
agree: they are in having teeth, in the proc&#339;lous centrum, in the
separate condition of the carpal and metacarpal (and of the tarsal
and metatarsal) bones; in having more than two bones in the fore-arm,
in the sacrum formed of few vertebræ, in the expanded pubic
(and prepubic) bones, in a long neck to the femur, and in the
modification of the wing by the great development of the phalanges
of one finger.</p>

<p>I therefore regard the Pterodactyles as forming a group of
equal value with birds, for which group the name Ornithosauria
is here used. It cannot form a separate class, because they have
a fundamental organization in common; and it cannot form an
order of birds, because its differences from birds are greater than
those of an order. It is a group which itself probably includes
several orders, and must constitute a sub-class, which finds its
place in nature side by side with birds and between mammals and
reptiles, thus:&mdash;</p>

<p>Giving a total expanse of about 13 feet. But, from the indications
of the wing-finger, I should incline to think an expanse of
10 feet a truer estimate. The largest species attained to twice
this size, and the smallest was a fourth as large. Another memoir
will present descriptions and restorations of the Greensand
species.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Habits.</span></p>

<p>The varying organization of different Ornithosaurians probably
depends on the different habits of the tribes. That they could
all fly is probable from the enormous radial crest to the humerus
and the great development of the wing-bones, to which a wing-membrane
was stretched, comparable to that of a Bat in texture,
but more comparable to a Bird in its extent. The groups with long
hind-legs probably had the membrane limited to the bones of the
arm, while in the species with small hind-legs it may have attained
even as great a development as in Bats, though there is no reason
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">« 105 »</a></span>
for suspecting that it extended to the tail. A Pterodactyle cannot
be supposed to have hung itself up by the hind-legs as does
a Bat, because the hind-claws appear invariably to be directed
forward. A Bat walks upon four legs with considerable elegance
and speed; the wing is folded in, close to the side, so as to be
scarcely noticed; and the outer claw is free to climb with. There
can be little doubt but that Pterodactyles walked in a similar
way. The thickened mammilate knob at the proximal end of the
first phalange is well calculated for contact with the ground. And
if it were supposed that the large wing-metacarpal bone were only
used to support the wing, and the small metacarpals only used to
support the claws by which the creature has sometimes been pictured
suspending itself, it would be difficult to believe that the
forces of pressure and tension in flying so exactly corresponded to
the forces manifested in suspension as to cause the large and the
small metacarpals invariably to attain the same length. A correspondence
of this kind may be presumed to indicate a correspondence
in function; and since the animal did not fly by means
of its claws, the inference is that it walked by means of the metacarpal
bones. In no other way could the bones have been used
equally. The avian ilium would suggest a probability that they
also at times stood erect like birds, from which position they
could with more ease expand their wings; nor is such an idea
opposed by the resemblance of some bones of the hind-limb to what
obtains in birds, and of the neck of the femur to what is seen in
mammals of great power in the hind-legs.</p>

<p>That they lived exclusively upon land and in air is improbable,
considering the circumstances under which their remains are
found. It is likely that they haunted the sea-shores, and, while
sometimes rowing themselves over the water with their powerful
wings, used the wing-membrane as does the Bat to enclose their prey
and bring it to the mouth. But the superior development of the
pneumatic foramina suggest that their activity was greater than
in ordinary sea-birds.</p>

<p>The large Cambridge Pterodactyles probably pursued a more
substantial prey than dragon-flies. Their teeth are well suited for
fish, but probably fowl and small mammal, and even fruits, made
a variety in their food. As the lord of the cliff, it may be presumed
to have taken toll of all animals that could be conquered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">« 106 »</a></span>
with tooth and nail. From its brain it might be regarded as an
intelligent animal. The jaws present indications of having been
sheathed with a horny covering, and some of the species show a
rugose anterior termination of the snout suggestive of fleshy lips
like those of the Bat, and which may have been similarly used to
stretch and clean the wing-membrane.</p>

<p>The high temperature, coupled with the sub-aerial life, are
opposed to the idea of the animal having been naked. The undisturbed
condition of the skeleton and some points of structure
are opposed to the idea of their having had large feathers. The
absence of such remains does not favour the hypothesis of their
having been covered with scales, though in the legs of birds a
scaly covering is met with. I should anticipate for them a filamentous
downy feather, or hair, like a Bat's. The Bat combs its
hair with its claws, and the Ornithosaurians may have used their
claws in a similar way.</p>

<p>They cannot be supposed to have been gregarious, from the
large number of species relatively to specimens. The reproduction
may have been much the same as in birds; and the young

<p><a name="Footnote_25" id="Footnote_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25"><span class="label">[Y]</span></a> The German animals form different family groups. And it cannot be
inferred that the structures seen in them pertained to Cambridge specimens.</p></div>

<p>In the head, Cambridge specimens show no trace of the parts
which are between the brain-cavity and the fore-part of the jaw.
The form and condition of the orbits, nares, and of the space
between them, vary in German specimens. Some Birds and
certain Ruminants, such as deer, the giraffe, &amp;c., have an interspace
between the orbits and nares corresponding to that in some
Pterodactyles, but no such perforation is found in living reptiles.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">« 107 »</a></span>
In mammals it appears to be surrounded by the frontal, nasal,
lachrymal, and often by the maxillary bone. In birds the bones
appear to be the lachrymal, nasal, maxillary and premaxillary, as
is the case with Pterodactyles, except that the nasal bones would
seem sometimes to be excluded. The chief peculiarity of the Pterodactyle
skull in this region is made by the malar bone (and,
according to some authors, the maxillary also) sending up a process
to meet the lachrymal. This is not seen in birds, but is
characteristic of many mammals and reptiles.</p>

<p>The premaxillary bone is single, as in birds and Iguana; but
it appears to attain as great a development as in birds, and to
occupy the portion of the jaw which among reptiles and mammals
is made by the maxillary bone. Owing to the great development
of the premaxillary bones, the exterior nares are placed far back
toward the middle of the skull as in birds, and not near the tip of
the snout as in living reptiles and most mammals.</p>

<p>The orbits in Pterodactyles are surrounded with bone, as is
commonly the case with mammals and reptiles. Among birds a
complete orbit is seen among the parrots, in which it is completed
below by a prolongation of the outer posterior corner of the
frontal, which would correspond to the post-frontal bone, and by
the lachrymal bone. Thus the malar bone, which in most mammals
and reptiles forms an important part of the lower margin of
the orbit, is in birds entirely excluded. In Pterodactyles the
malar bone is placed between the lachrymal and the post-frontal
process of the frontal bone.</p>

<p>The quadrate bone in German Pterodactyles, instead of being
vertical as in birds, stretches obliquely forward below the malar
bone, so that the articulation for the lower jaw is brought forward
to be under the middle of the orbit. In <i>Pterodactylus Kochi</i> and
in other species there appears to be a process, or small separate
triradiate bone, comparable to a diminished lacertian post-frontal,
and homologous with the post-frontal process of the parrots. Its
upper branch meets the frontal. In some genera the front appears
to meet the malar. The lower branch goes to the front of the
quadrate bone, and the backward branch goes to the squamosal
immediately above the articulation for the quadrate bone. Thus
it is a post-frontal bone resembling that of the Iguana, but modified
and adapted to a cranium like that of a bird. Its form and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">« 108 »</a></span>
size in the different genera are very variable. No similar development
is seen among mammals, where the post-frontals have
probably ceased to exist. It is a carious point of resemblance,
but from the other resemblances to Iguana being so few it is
robbed of much of its force as a mark of affinity, and becomes
of interest chiefly as an evidence of independent persistence of
structures.</p>

<p>The pterygoid and palatine bones approximate to those of
bird and lizard in Pterodactylus crassirostris. And the bones in
Pterodactylus suevicus, which Quenstedt names vomera, should
rather have been named palatines. There is a bone in Goldfuss'
specimen, between the malar and palatine, which he identifies with
the transverse bone, but it is not seen in any other specimen.</p>

<p>The ribs sometimes appear to articulate by single heads, but in
P. crassirostris they are apparently articulated as in the Crocodile.
Some species show abdominal ribs like those of some reptiles; but
the segments of the mammalian sternum and abdominal ribs are
to be regarded as homologous structures. The vertebræ offer considerable
variety in size and shape, but the greatest variation in
number is seen in the tail, which is sometimes stiff and long, and
sometimes short. The pelvic bones show a large amount of variation
in different genera, often appearing to be crocodilian, sometimes
lacertian, sometimes mammalian. In the aim the humerus
is variable in the length of the radial crest, and the metacarpus
also varies in length.</p>

<p>When the external similarity of the skeletons of birds is borne
in mind, it is impossible, without disregard of classification altogether,
to place animals differing so widely as do the different
Ornithosaurians in the few genera in which they are at present
packed.</p>

<h2><a name="CLASSIFICATION" id="CLASSIFICATION">CLASSIFICATION.</a></h2>


<p>The orders of Ornithosaurians may be established hereafter.
Under the name Pterosauria, Prof. Owen founded one order which
has for its type the Pterodactylus longirostris.</p>

<p>Von Meyer proposed to separate this order into two groups,
one with two phalanges in the wing-finger, of which Ornithopterus
is the only example, forming his <span class="smcap">Diathri</span>; while the other group,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">« 109 »</a></span>
<span class="smcap">Tetrathri</span>, or those "with four fingers, comprised all other Pterosaurians.
The Tetrathri he again subdivided, following out, as he
states, the suggestion of Munster and Goldfuss, into <i>Dentirostres</i>
or such Pterodactyles as have the jaws furnished with teeth to
their anterior termination; and the <i>Subulirostres</i>, or such as want
teeth at the extremities of the jaws. To the former group he
left the name Pterodactylus, and to the latter was given the
name Rhamphorhynchus. Von Meyer says that he might easily
have made a few more species, as will be evident to those who
inspect his plates, but he "believes that the students of living
animals go too far in their tendency to subdivide:" a fancy that,
if indulged in by Palæontologists, would have the effect of restoring
the old Linnæan groups; and a complaint which, although
often heard, has usually come from those who do not readily discern
and appraise classificational characters. In Palæontology genera
are sometimes co-extensive with orders, while species often mean
genera. It may be wearisome to the collector to be lured on to
follow the devious ways of a science, but Palæontology, the source
whence the mysteries of existing nature must unravel their meaning,
is the handmaid of all nature's truths which have been buried
in evolving the existing creation; and a duty devolves upon Palæontologists
to make the past an inseparable part of the present,
by applying to the two the same scientific method.</p>

<p>A year previous to the formation of Owen's Pterosauria, Bonaparte
named the Order Ornithosaurii, and divided it into a family&mdash;Pterodactylæ,
and a sub-family Pterodactylinæ.</p>

<p>Fitzinger (<i>Systema Reptilium</i>, 1843) also used the same ordinal
name, and recognized three genera&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Pachyrhamphus</i>, of which the type is Pterodactylus crassirostris
(Gold.).</p>

<p><i>Pterodactylus</i>, with the type P. longirostris (Cuv.).</p>

<p>And <i>Ornithocephalus</i>, with the type O. brevirostris (Sömm.).</p>

<p>These and other attempts at classification all endeavour to
subdivide Ornithosaurians by the head or by the tail. Other
characters for primary divisions may be obtained from the pelvis.</p>

<p>In the majority of German Pterodactyles the ilium extends for
a long distance in front of the os pubis, and only for a very short
distance behind the large ischium; and the small pubis from its
anterior margin gives attachment to a large prepubic bone, which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">« 110 »</a></span>
resembles in form the os pubis of the Crocodile<a name="FNanchor_26" id="FNanchor_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[Z]</a>, and is unlike
that of the Monotreme. These appear to include the long-legged
animals with short tails, at present called Pterodactyles, and form
a well-marked family or order.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_26" id="Footnote_26"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26"><span class="label">[Z]</span></a> Prof. Haughton, from a study of the bones and muscles, came to the
conclusion that the pubic bones of Crocodiles are the marsupial bones.</p></div>

<p>Another kind of pelvis is that in which the ilium extends a
short way in front of the acetabulum, in which the pelvic bones
inclose a much larger space. These include the Cambridge Ornithosaurians,
the Rhamphorhynchus, and the Dimorphodon, and
form another well-marked family.</p>

<p>These long-tailed Pterodactyles subdivide into three sub-families&mdash;Rhamphorhynchæ,
Dimorphodontæ, and Ornithocheiræ. The
four families may then be defined thus:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Pterodactylæ</i>. Tail short. Hind-legs long. Ilium narrow,
extending far anterior to the acetabulum; ischium extending
behind the acetabulum. Epipubic bones ficiform. Head
with the middle holes large, often confluent with the exterior
nares. Jaws toothed to the anterior extremity.</p>

<p><i>Rhamphorhynchæ</i>. Tail long and stiff. Hind-legs short.
Pubis and ischium small, oblique to ilium, which extends
less far anteriorly than in Pterodactylæ. Epipubic bones
narrow and bent; they unite mesially and form a three-sided
bow in front of the pelvis. Head with the middle
holes and nares both small. Jaws never toothed to the
anterior extremity.</p>

<p><i>Dimorphodontæ</i>. Tail long and stiff. Hind-legs long. Pubis
and ischium forming an expanded sheet of bone at right
angles with the narrow ilium, which extends as far behind
as in front [prepubic bones triangular (?) attached by the
apex of the triangle]. Head with the nares and middle
holes large. Quadrate bone large. Jaws with large teeth
at the extremities, and small teeth behind. No sacrum.</p>

<p><i>Ornithocheiræ</i>. Tail long and flexible. Hind-legs short. Pelvis
as in Dimorphodontæ. [Epipubic bones with a small
attachment, form unknown.] Head with the quadrate
bone small. Sacrum of not fewer than three vertebræ.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">« 111 »</a></span></p></div>

<p>In the Pterodactylæ the genera are&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Pterodactylus</i> (Cuvier), in which the exterior nares are at the
sides of the face, very large, and only partially, if at all,
separated by bone from the small middle hole of the head. The head
is elongated. The neck is long. Among others, it includes the
species P. longirostris, P. Kochi, P. scolopaciceps, P. longicollum.</p>

<p><i>Ornithocephalus</i> (Sömmerring), in which the anterior nares are
entirely separated from the middle holes of the head, both being
small, and the latter exceedingly small. The head is short The
neck is short. The large ischium appears to be excluded from the
acetabulum, and the ilium appears to extend less far forward than
in Pterodactylus<a name="FNanchor_27" id="FNanchor_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[AA]</a>.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_27" id="Footnote_27"></a><a href="#FNanchor_27"><span class="label">[AA]</span></a> So far as can be judged from figures, it appears to have but three bones
in the wing-finger: what Cuvier regarded as a terminal and fourth joint, the
bone <i>n</i>, Pl. <span class="smcap">XXIII.</span> fig. 7, <i>Oss. Foss.</i>, appearing to me to be the fibula of the tibia
marked <i>e</i>. <i>s</i> in the same figure would be the terminal phalange, and <i>r</i> the first
phalange, as may be proved by measuring them with those of the other hand,
so that a phalange is missing from between them. Both the terminal phalanges
appear to be hooked at the termination. Goldfuss figures the phalanges so as
to make the bone which appears to be fibula in Sömmerring and Cuvier look
like a fourth phalange.</p></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Pachyrhamphus</i> (Fitzinger). The nares are entirely separated from
the middle holes of the head; both are large. The head is thick
and massive. The prepubic bones meet mesially. No evidence of
the number of phalanges in the wing-finger. The quadrate bone
is massive, but has small attachment to the skull. Two sacral
vertebræ. Wing-metacarpal very short. The type is P. crassirostris
(Goldfuss).</p>

<p><i>Cycnorhamphus</i> (Seeley). Nares very small, looking upward from
a swan-like beak. The middle hole of the skull very large and
elongated and lateral. Neck long. Wing-metacarpal long. Four
joints in the wing-finger. Ilium widening in front. Epipubic bones
meeting mesially. The type is Pterodactylus suevicus (Quenstedt).</p></div>

<p>In the Rhamphorhynchæ at present there appears to be but one
genus known:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">« 112 »</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>Rhamphorhynchus (von Meyer). The nares and middle holes
are both small, ovate, of nearly equal size, and close together
at the side of the head in front of the orbit.</p></div>

<p>In the Dimorphodontæ the only genus is</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Dimorphodon</i> (Owen). It has the nares enormously large. The middle
holes are also large.</p></div>

<p>In the Ornithocheiræ the genus is</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Ornithocheirus</i> (Seeley), in which teeth are prolonged anterior to
the muzzle, and the palate has a longitudinal ridge.</p></div>

<p>With the osteological illustrations of the Ornithosauria are
arranged some premaxillary bones, which show varieties of form
of the snout. These variations of shape serve easily to indicate
different species. And the following memoranda from those specimens
and other specimens in the drawers form a synopsis of the
species of the Cambridge genera, which may hereafter be fully
elucidated from the copious materials in the series of associated
remains.</p>

<p>The fragment is 2<sup>7</sup>/<sub>8</sub>ths inches long, with the elliptical teeth opposite
to each other, 6 on a side on the palate, and one pair in front.
The first three teeth are large; behind these the teeth are about half
the size. The palate is gently convex, with a faint median ridge,
and measures from side to side over the fourth and subsequent
sockets <sup>13</sup>/<sub>16</sub>ths of an inch. The height of the jaw at the fourth
socket 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inch. The sides converge to an acute rounded rostral
keel. The jaws appear to have been long. The anterior termination
is vascular.</p>

<p>The rostral keel figured by Owen Pl. <span class="smcap">I</span>, fig. 1 <i>d</i>, in the
1st Supt. <i>Cret. Reptiles</i>, is not square as represented there, but
rounded; the sides converge more acutely, and at the ridge the
keel is not half so wide as the figure makes it. The enormous
size of the third tooth-socket is partly due to the cracked bone
having absorbed more phosphate of lime than it could hold, and
extended the cracks to fissures. The type specimen shows that
there was another pair of sockets in front of, but quite close to,
those which appear to terminate the lower jaw.</p>

<p>A portion of a premaxillary bone fractured at both ends, and
two inches long, corresponds with Dr Bowerbank's fossil figured
Pl. <span class="smcap">XXVII.</span> fig. 1, 3, 4, in the Palæontographical volume for 1851.
The palate is just as wide; the median ridge, the same; the teeth
the same in shape and as far apart. The jaw is of the same
depth, but does not deepen so rapidly behind. The only other
difference is that the sockets of the teeth are less prominent on
the sides, and appear to look more directly down.</p>

<p>The ridge in which the converging sides meet is well rounded
in a dentary bone which may have pertained to this species. In
the space of two inches and a quarter are 5 teeth, the posterior
four extending over two inches, the other pair being in front.
The palatal surface is <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> of an inch broad behind the third tooth,
and rather more than <sup>5</sup>/<sub>8</sub> of an inch broad behind the fourth tooth.
The length of the 4th or of the 5th sockets is two-thirds that of
the second or third. In front of the 5th tooth, the jaw is an
inch deep, and it tapers in a curve to the anterior end. The teeth
behind the third have interspaces greater than the length of the
sockets; that between the 4th and 5th being <sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub> of an inch, while
the socket only measures a quarter of an inch long. Behind the
2nd socket commences the palatal groove, broad in fronts but
narrowing behind; and its sides instead of diverging as in the
type, are concave so as to form a channel like a straightened <i>Siliquaria</i>
shell. The halves of the palate bevel off so as to make a
right angle with each other, and greater angles with the flat sides.</p>

<p>Dentary bone. Broken at both ends, and wanting all its
teeth, this interesting fossil shows the suture where its whole
length rests on the angular bone which almost reached to the
termination of the beak, quite unlike what is seen in any German
Pterodactyle.</p>

wide, with the alveolar margins parallel. The palatal surface 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>
inch long, is divided into 3 equal strips; the middle one being
a deep glossal groove, slightly narrowing in front, and deepening
behind, made by two inclined flat surfaces. The lateral strips
are horizontal behind, and in front slope a little outward. The
tooth-sockets are oval, directed outward, and as long as the interspaces,
though these seem to get longer behind. In an inch and
a quarter there are four teeth. Below the teeth, the sides of the
jaw are compressed: though nearly parallel at the hinder fracture,
the flattened surfaces approximate in front till they meet
in a sharp keel, which appears to make an acute angle of about
45° with the palate; and below, where the jaw is an inch deep
extends for half an inch in front of the suture with the angular

<p>Middle part of a premaxillary bone fractured behind and in

<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> an inch wide in front, and <sup>5</sup>/<sub>8</sub>ths of an inch wide behind; it is
compressed mesially into a strong angular keel, between which
and the teeth there is a shallow groove on each side. The groove
dies away behind, and the converging parts of the keel occupy the
whole space between the teeth. The teeth-sockets are small,
elliptical, not opposite to each other, and placed along a distinct
flattened tooth area, which looks downward and outward and
separates the palate from the side of the jaw. The first pair of
sockets preserved are almost <sup>3</sup>/<sub>16</sub>ths of an inch long and <sup>1</sup>/<sub>16</sub>th of
an inch wide. The interspace between that tooth and the next
tooth behind is <sup>7</sup>/<sub>16</sub> of an inch. Separated by similar interspaces,
behind these on one side are two sockets, and on the other

<p>The small piece of premaxillary on which this species is
founded indicates a small animal, and nearly resembles the
jaw of <i>O. microdon</i>.</p>

<p>It is scarcely an inch long; nearly <sup>9</sup>/<sub>16</sub>ths inch high behind, and
nearly <sup>7</sup>/<sub>16</sub>ths of an inch high in front, so that it tapers very rapidly,
and could scarcely have been an inch longer in front.</p>

<p>The nose is well rounded, but the sides are a little concave,
and become well pinched in in the middle, behind, showing
the near approach as I think to the nostril.</p>

<p>The palate half an inch broad, is divided into two concave
channels by the strong and sharp median ridge, which projects
below the alveolar margins. The dental margins are not rounded
as in <i>C. microdon</i>, but flattened, making more than a right
angle with both the outer side-wall and palate. The interspaces
between the teeth are rough, looking as though they had supported
minute teeth. The alveolar margin is a tenth of an inch
wide; along it are the perfectly circular sockets, a sixteenth of an
inch in diameter. There are 3 sockets between <sup>5</sup>/<sub>8</sub> of an inch,
so that they are separated by 3 times their diameter. The
palate is obliquely impressed with blood-vessels running forward
to the teeth from the median ridge.</p>

<p>The points in which this jaw differs from that of <i>O.
microdon</i> are that in this species the teeth are circular instead
of being oval; that the interspaces here are as long as in that
species, though this jaw is only two-thirds the width; that
instead of having a sharp keel on the upper surface, this has
a well rounded roof. That though the jaw is scarcely higher
than it is wide, it shows strong furrows running up to the
nares, while in <i>O. microdon</i>, though the proportions are the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">« 116 »</a></span>
same, the sides are perfectly flat without trace of pinching in,
while the line of the nasal opening is indicated by a faint
furrow running all along the jaw. And lastly it differs in
size, which, where the sutures are lost, may be important in
discriminating forms.</p>

<p>Premaxillary bone. The fossil is nearly 1<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub>ths inch long, and at
the proximal end, where it is less than <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub>ths of an inch high, has flat
sides, which converge to form a keel which is depressed anteriorly
and rounded so that where fractured in front the bone is <sup>7</sup>/<sub>16</sub>ths of
an inch deep. The palatal surface contains two wide concave channels,
between which descends a sharp median ridge, which behind
becomes more prominent than the alveolar border.</p>

<p>The palate is <sup>5</sup>/<sub>8</sub>ths of an inch wide. The alveolar margins are
compressed and rounded. The small tooth-sockets are oval, and
four are contained in 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub>th inch; they look downward.</p>

<p>There is a small tip of a jaw associated with this fossil, which
is so like that it might be part of the bone broken off before
fossilization. It corresponds in every way except that the teeth
are closer. In this terminal lanceolate fragment there are in <sup>5</sup>/<sub>8</sub>ths
of an inch four teeth. The snout is terminated by two, which are
close together.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Ornithocheirus Huxleyi</span> (Seeley).</p>

<p>The only specimen of this species yet known is the greater
part of a dentary bone contained in the Museum of the Geological
Survey. An inch and <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> long and <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub>ths of an inch wide, it is less
than half an inch deep: the sides slowly converge towards the
front, and it appears to have had an obtusely lanceolate beak.
The under surface is convex, too inflated for trace of a keel, and
tapers to the end of the beak, which, with the left alveolar margin
is abraded. The palatal surface is smooth at its front end, but
two diverging ridges soon arise and form the boundary of a posteriorly
deepening mesial channel, which is a quarter of an inch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">« 117 »</a></span>
wide at the fracture. These ridges too, which are parallel with
the compressed and rounded alveolar margins, convert the lateral
spaces into shallow channels. The right side shows the sockets
of 3 small oval teeth separated by interspaces wider than teeth.
A tooth and two interspaces measure <sup>7</sup>/<sub>16</sub>ths of an inch.</p>

<p>The only cretaceous Pterodactyle which this at all resembles
is <i>O. microdon</i>, but the palate is wider than in that species; the
sides converge towards each other more rapidly, as though it
belonged to a species with a shorter snout.</p>

<p>I am indebted to Prof. Huxley for the opportunity of making
a notice of this species.</p>

<p>The fragment is 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inch long, with two large elliptical tooth-sockets
on each side of the flattened palate, and one pair in front.
The third socket is separated from the fourth by a considerable
interspace. Between the third sockets arises the median palatal
ridge, and from the inner margin of each socket a lateral ridge
appears to be continued. Behind the third socket the jaw measures
<sup>11</sup>/<sub>16</sub>ths of an inch from side to side, and <sup>10</sup>/<sub>16</sub>ths of an inch
high. The sides converge and round convexly into each other.
The jaws appear to have been long; It is only known by upper
jaws. The type specimen shows the socket of another tooth in
front of the last one figured by Prof. Owen. It is directed outward
at a greater angle, and separated from the hinder one by
a wall not <sup>1</sup>/<sub>16</sub>th of an inch thick, and the teeth of this pair must
have been parted from each other by a film equally thin. There
is no truncation of the snout as in <i>O. Woodwardi</i>.</p>

<p>Another specimen shows some variations. This fragment of
a premaxillary bone is fractured through the third pair of tooth-sockets
in front and through the seventh pair behind. It is about
2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub>th inches long; the palate is <sup>11</sup>/<sub>16</sub>ths of an inch wide behind the
great tooth, and maintains the same width. The jaw is <sup>11</sup>/<sub>16</sub>ths of

gently convex, and imperceptibly unite to form the well-rounded
depressed mesial ridge of the beak. From the front of the third

are ovate, rather smaller, and closer together than in the type of
<i>O. Fittoni</i>; margins elevated. The variations from types are so
many, and often so considerable, as to suggest the idea that the
fossil groups called species may in the living animals have often
been genera.</p>

<p>A fragment of premaxillary bone two inches long, fractured
behind the socket for the seventh tooth. It most nearly resembles

palate is <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> an inch wide; behind the sixth socket it is <sup>5</sup>/<sub>8</sub>ths of an

The palate is flattened, with a sharp slight mesial keel and a wide
concave channel on each side which dies away in front. The first
pair of teeth are in front of the snout, rather small, and look forward.
In this specimen the large third tooth is not developed on
the left side. The second and third sockets are large and close
together; the succeeding teeth are parted from each other by
interspaces equal to their own diameter. They are gibbously elliptical.
The sides of the jaw are gently convex from above downward;
they round into each other to form a narrow rostral keel.
Behind the second socket the jaw is <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> an inch high; behind the
sixth it is nearly <sup>7</sup>/<sub>8</sub>ths of an inch high.</p>

the lateral margins approximate very slowly, and in front it

in that space were on each side six large round teeth, almost as

point more forward. A moderate, sharp, median ridge descends
in the flattened palate, making its lateral halves a little concave.

The jaw, which is <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> an inch deep behind, tapers to its termination
more rapidly than does <i>O. Fittoni</i>. The flat sides similarly converge,
and form a well-rounded ridge, which does not get blunter

tooth-sockets are entirely above the palatal surface, so that they
are better seen from the side of the jaw than from the palate.</p>

<p>Fragments of premaxillary bones. The largest portion is 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>
inches long, and is fractured behind the socket for the fourth
tooth, and the upper part of the nose is also broken away. The
palate is flattened, with the median part slightly convex. The
sides of the jaw converge upward, but not rapidly; in front they
round into each other, but there is a slight mesial depression.
The front pair of teeth are large, separated from each other and
from the second pair by films of bone. Above the first pair of
sockets, so as to look downward and forward, is an impressed
lunate area <sup>9</sup>/<sub>16</sub>ths of an inch wide and <sup>5</sup>/<sub>16</sub>ths of an inch high, to
which a soft lip may have been attached. This area is in the
same plane with the first pair of teeth and at right angles with the
upper outline of the nose. The sockets of the first pair of teeth
are a little smaller than the second pair; they are both about half
an inch in diameter and nearly circular. An interspace of <sup>3</sup>/<sub>16</sub>ths
of an inch separates the second socket from the third. The tooth
is elliptical, the socket being narrower and longer than that of the
second. The palatal interspace between the third pair is more
than <sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub>ths of an inch. The interspace between the third and fourth
sockets is about <sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub>ths of an inch. The diameter of the nearly
circular fourth socket is <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub>th of an inch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">« 125 »</a></span></p>

<p>The overhanging lunate lip space, with the size of the teeth
and width of the palate, abundantly distinguish this species.</p>

<p>I regard the fragment on which this species was founded
as being the terminal end, and not a section of a jaw; partly
from the rounding of the lateral surfaces to the front, and
chiefly from the snapped off teeth in the middle of the truncated
anterior end, for they are smaller than the pair behind them,
and look forward at a greater angle, so that the converging
sockets of both pairs meet behind. These characters are well
shown in Mr Dinkel's excellent figure, Pl. <span class="smcap">II.</span> fig. 3<i>a</i>. Second Sup.
Palæont. The palate is destroyed, and gives no clue to the
bone being either lower or upper.</p>

<p>Another specimen, rather smaller, shows the rostrum well
rounded; the front is truncated at right angles to it: there is
the same rounding of its lower part into the sides, and the stumps
of the front pair of teeth are visible though they are again worn
level with the rugose front of the snout.</p>

<p>But the finest fragment of this species is a rostral end, (perhaps
of the upper jaw) three inches long, two inches deep, and with the
palate as wide. It indicates 5 teeth on a side: the front pair
small, 2nd and 3rd much larger, and two pairs behind, which
are smaller. The palate is flat, and attains its greatest width
at the third tooth, behind which it contracts noticeably. The
third tooth is more than half an inch in diameter, the fourth
is <sup>5</sup>/<sub>16</sub>ths of an inch long. The spaces between teeth seem equal to
the long diameter of the sockets, which are oval and straight.
The sides round into the front of the muzzle more gradually in
this specimen than in the others. An impressed line runs
along the median ridge of the upper surface. Just as the jaw
gets narrower behind, so the well-rounded upper surface becomes
more acute behind.</p>

<p>Behind the third socket the palate measures 1<sup>7</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch from side
to side, and the jaw is there nearly 2 inches high.</p>

<p>This is the most massive Pterodactyle jaw known. In the
recent state it may have indicated a creature sufficiently distinguished
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">« 126 »</a></span>
from those to which the smaller fossils belonged,
but now the divergence of characters is so slight as to be for
zoological purposes of no value.</p>

<p>It is related to O. Fittoni; the chief points of difference
being the truncated muzzle, the compression behind the third
tooth, the much sharper (?) dorsal ridge, and the large size of
the head.</p>

<p>A fragment of premaxillary bone, well distinguished from
every other specimen, except one in the collection of Mr Reed of
York, which is here named <i>O. Reedi</i>. It is a large head, with
larger teeth than any known species. The jaw is truncated in
front, with a rugose vertical area in front reaching 1<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inch high
from the palate, on which the usual front pair of teeth are not
seen. At the angle of this front area with the palate is a large
elliptical tooth <sup>9</sup>/<sub>16</sub>ths of an inch wide, and behind it, with an
interspace of <sup>3</sup>/<sub>16</sub>ths of an inch, is a socket measuring <sup>10</sup>/<sub>16</sub>ths of an
inch in length; the next interspace is about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub>th of an inch, and
the next nearly circular socket is <sup>5</sup>/<sub>16</sub>ths long; then another interspace
of <sup>1</sup>/<sub>8</sub>th of an inch, and another and a smaller tooth. The
palate appears to have been channelled. The sides of the jaw are
flat, or slightly concave, and where fractured above, are 3 inches
high. Above the rugose vertical area of the snout, is an area,
concave from back to front, reaching up to the rostral keel; it is
flat from side to side behind, and convex from side to side in
front. So much as is preserved measures 1<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inch in length, and
appears to be relatively narrower than in O. Reedi.</p>



<p class="caption3">XXIV.</p>

<p class="center"><span class="smcap">Ornithocheirus Reedi</span> (Seeley).</p>

<p>The anterior part of an upper jaw has flattened slightly
concave sides, which converge above so as to form boundaries
of (1) a flat triangular area which looks anteriorly, and of (2)
an oblong area, traversed by a mesial groove, which looks upward
and forward and is concave from back to front. In the lower
half of the truncated triangular anterior termination are the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">« 127 »</a></span>
remains of the stumps of the two anterior teeth; they are oval in
outline, <sup>9</sup>/<sub>16</sub>ths of an inch high, and <sup>7</sup>/<sub>16</sub>ths of an inch wide; they are
parted by an interspace nearly <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> of an inch wide, which becomes
concave vertically as it rounds on to the palatal surface. All the
front triangular surface above the teeth is rough: its entire height
is about 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inch, and is nearly as wide across the base. The
side rounds a little into the concave median upper surface, and
into the triangular front; so much as is preserved measures 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub>
inches high, and 1<sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub> inch long. The palatal surface, which is very
small and badly preserved, is 1<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inch wide behind, but gives no
indication of further widening. On its outer border are seen two
large circular teeth <sup>5</sup>/<sub>8</sub>ths of an inch in diameter; they are separated
by a median palatal interspace of <sup>7</sup>/<sub>8</sub>ths of an inch. Where
it is fractured behind, the specimen shows the sockets of another
pair of teeth behind these, with an interspace of <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> of an inch in
the antero-posterior direction. The palate is convex.</p>

<p>The superior oblong area is concave in length as well as
transversely. It makes a great angle with the triangular front
of which it is the upward continuation; so much as is preserved
extends 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inch in length; it is about <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> an inch wide.</p>

<p>I am indebted to W. Reed, Esq. of York, for the opportunity
of making a notice of this species, which closely resembles <i>O.
capito</i>.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The species which follow were separated in the "Index to the Ornithosauria,"
&amp;c. as a different genus. That proposal might still be sustained, for
these massive truncated jaws are unlike the spear-shaped jaws of many of the
species. And to the minds of some readers the forms already described will
arrange themselves in groups which not improbably indicate genera. But a
re-examination of the type <i>Pterodactylus simus</i> (Owen) has convinced me that
it is a <i>lower jaw</i>, and therefore it affords no evidence of the presence or absence
of the peculiar front premaxillary teeth which characterize nearly all the Cretaceous
species.</p></div>

<p>The palate is 2<sup>3</sup>/<sub>4</sub> inches long, and at the second pair of teeth
about <sup>7</sup>/<sub>8</sub>ths of an inch wide. It is fractured at the end through
the fifth socket, and at the side along the palatal groove. The
first pair of teeth is smaller and closer together than the others.
The palatal interspace between the second pair is <sup>3</sup>/<sub>8</sub>ths of an inch;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">« 128 »</a></span>
between the third pair, which are large teeth, it is <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> an inch.
The sockets are sub-circular, and are not separated from each
other by wider interspaces than their own length. In front is a
long triangular rugose area, convex from above downward, a distance
of 1<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inch; and concave from side to side, a width above of
rather more than <sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> an inch. Below this the flattened sides converge
to a blunt keel; where, fractured, the jaw is 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inches deep.
There are several fragments of species allied to the last; one
has the triangular area in front very small, only half as high as
in the type and very narrow, for the sides are gently rounded
into it. It is marked by short longitudinal furrows, impressed
vessels I think, while in O. simus the surface is irregularly rough.
The first pair of teeth are much larger than in O. simus; they
are longer, more conical, and circular, and separated by as wide a
space as the second pair. There is not much to found a species on,
but as it appears to be quite distinct from O. simus, it is named
<i>O. Carteri</i>. Another fragment, with the area very long, is marked
<i>O. platyrhinus</i>. But a sufficiency of species has been indicated to
make known the Ornithosaurian fauna of the Cambridge Greensand.
And the detailed description of critical types and of the
other parts of the skeletons is beyond the general osteology of the
tribe, and will rather belong to a memoir in which this flock of
Pterodactyles will be restored to their living forms.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>A fragment of the lower jaw of a large Ornithocheirus has been obtained
from an outlier of the Upper Greensand at Rocken End in the Isle of Wight.
It appears to indicate a distinct species. It is 2<sup>1</sup>/<sub>2</sub> inches long, and shows three
large teeth still preserved in their sockets. The extreme width outside the
third pair of sockets is nearly 2 inches. The sides, which are slightly concave
from above downward, converge so as to give the broken end a triangular
outline. In front is a small sub-triangular area, deeply scored with vascular
markings; below this the outline slopes obliquely backward, and the two sides
there round convexly into each other. The first socket is <sup>7</sup>/<sub>16</sub>ths of an inch
long, the tooth coarsely striated, and like the others elliptical; the interspace
between the first and the second teeth is <sup>5</sup>/<sub>16</sub>ths of an inch. The second tooth,
probably immature, is an inch in length, smooth, and like the third traversed
in front and behind by a slight lateral ridge; at the base it measures <sup>5</sup>/<sub>16</sub>ths of
an inch from front to back. The third tooth is rather less than <sup>5</sup>/<sub>8</sub>ths of an
inch from front to back. The interspace between the first and second <i>sockets</i>,
which the teeth do not entirely fill, is more than <sup>1</sup>/<sub>4</sub> of an inch. The posterior
margin of each socket is elevated into a sort of collar.</p></div>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
